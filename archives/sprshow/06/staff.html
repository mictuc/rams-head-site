Jeanette Woodburn</b> (Producer) was a senior majoring in history before she graduated winter quarter. She is one of the few people crazy enough to take on producing twice (previously producing Original Winter One Acts 2004).  Once Cabaret closes, she plans to buy a lawn chair and sit on the lawn of Roth with a book and something cold.  She wants to thank her family and Michael for their love and support, the friends who wormed their way into my schedule, Roth for keeping things exciting, the SM family past and present, and most importantly, the cast and staff who made every minute of this process a reminder of why she chose to produce in the first place.
</p>
<p><b>
Alex Mallory</b> (Director) has been blessed by the theatre gods with the show of a lifetime. She is grateful to those involved in “Not Another Branner Musical” (May, ’05) for preparing her to direct a full-fledged show this year. Ram’s Head exploits include lighting design for Gaieties 2005: Kill Julie, stage management for Pinkertons and assistant sound design for Company. She has also played two fourteen-year-old girls in murder scenes (The Love Talker, Roberto Zucco) for the Drama Department, and her favorite past theatrical endeavors have been directing Lebensraum and stage managing The Laramie Project for Gunn High School. Alex would like to thank her sexy cast, incredible staff, Ram's Head family, Julia, Craig, her parents, brother and chocolate lab, Jazzy. I love you all
</p>
<p><b>
Emily Gerth</b> (Stage Manager) is a junior majoring in Public Policy who has convinced herself that the message of the show justifies her spending less time on her classes. She has been technical crew for Gaieties 2003, Kiss Me, Kate and Pinkertons as well as the Assistant Stage Manager for Gaieties 2004.  Emily thanks the show’s talented cast and devoted staff for allowing her to schedule their lives. She also is grateful to her two lovely assistants for being both hilarious and highly competent as well as her friends who kept her sane through it all.  Having fallen into an orchestra pit during her last Ram's Head experience, she is thrilled that the set designer has filled this pit with platforms. She is still avoiding edges. Solid food rocks.
</p>
<p><b>
Nalani Grace</b> (Vocal Director) is a senior majoring in Human Biology.  She hopes to return to her home state of Hawaii for medical school.  This is her first musical, though she was a member of Testimony A Cappella during 2002-2003, and studied voice for five years in Honolulu.  She currently teaches singing to 7th- and 8th-graders in East Palo Alto.  Nalani would like to thank her family (Mom, Dad, Aimee, Cameron, Trevor, and Noelle), relatives, and close friends for their continued support, encouragement, motivation, and love.  She would also like to thank her voice teachers, Neva Rego and Betty Grierson, for their high expectations and meticulous instruction.  Lastly, Nalani would also like to thank her phenomenal staff and cast for their hard work and dedication, and for the opportunity to be part of such a great production.
</p>
<p><b>
Ted Sands</b> (Music Director) is a Stanford sophomore overwhelmingly addicted to conducting.  Other than double majoring in Urban Studies and Economics, conducting the Santa Clara Vanguard Cadets, giving Stanford tours, playing trumpet in the LSJUMB, and managing social events for Sigma Nu Fraternity, Cabaret is just about the only thing on his plate.  Still, this is his first Ram's Head production experience, and one he hopes to recreate in his remaining Stanford years.
</p>
<p><b>
Clare Tobin</b> (Choreographer) is a senior majoring in human biology.  Actually, she's already finished, and is now very much enjoying her time at Camp Stanford.  She is looking forward to using her Stanford education to dance professionally next year, at least until her inner geek demands a return to grad school.  Clare would like to thank the amazing cast for somehow making dances appear from her cryptic hobbling this way and that on a sprained ankle, and the staff because they are just plain fantastic.  She would also like to thank her residents, who came to see the show so they could get a theme point, and her family and assistant fight choreographer who came just because.
</p>
<p><b>
Becca Thal</b> (Technical Director) is a senior co-terming in English and Ram’s Head. Her Technical Director credits include Gaieties 2003, Original Winter One Acts 2004, Kiss Me, Kate, and Company. Cabaret will be her final production with Ram’s Head (that’s a promise). She wishes to thank Kent Griffin, her wonderful mother Patricia Barron, and the rest of her family for all their love and support; her drama mentors Paul, Ross, and Kenny; and the amazing cast and staff of Cabaret (especially Andrew and Storm for breaking their own promises to retire).
</p>
<p><b>
Andrew M. Reid</b> (Set Designer) is honored and somewhat surprised to be designing his sixth Ram's Head Spring Musical.  It has been a great experience working with this great cast, staff, and crew on Cabaret and he hopes you enjoy the show as much as he enjoyed working on it.  Andrew previously set designed West Side Story, 2003; sound designed Company, 2005; and lighting designed Kiss Me Kate, 2004; The Mystery of Edwin Drood, 2002; A Chorus Line , 2001; and Gaieties 2002, 2003, &amp; 2004 for Ram's Head.  For the Stanford Drama Department, he has lighting designed Mother Courage, 2005; Maria, 2004; Measure for Measure, 2002; and Entertaining Mr. Sloan, 2002 and has worked as an assistant lighting designer at Broadway by the Bay in San Mateo.
</p>
<p><b>
Storm Staley</b> (Lighting Designer) has been a fixture in the Ram's Head organization for a few years now, to the point that people are wondering when he'll finally leave. Amazingly, however, this is the first spring musical for which he has done lighting design, having been too busy in the past, either with sound design or his long-pursued goal of not letting theatre take over his life. (He has failed outstandingly on that last, given the circumstances under which you are reading this). He wishes to thank his fabulous programmer, Chelsea Vargas, his assistant lighting designer, Sarah Young, and his two excellent spotlight operators. His lighting design for Cabaret is inspired by the thought that 1930s Berlin nightclubs could have been so much better had they been jazzed up with some 1980s lighting technology. (Stanford doesn't have up-to-date lighting technology either).
      Enjoy the show. 
</p>
<p><b>
Alex Bullitt</b> (Sound Designer) is a Sophomore majoring in Mechanical Engineering. This is his fifth show with Ram's Head, and his second as Sound Designer.  Alex thanks his parents for their continual support, his sister Ethel for her endless insight, and his sister Marjorie for telling him to  "suck it up" when he was down. Alex has recently realized that clothing exists in other colors than black. This concept shocked him to his very core, and he has retreated to his mixing board while he comes to grips with this idea.
</p>

<p>
<b>Joseph Tan</b> (Rehearsal Pianist) has always wanted to be a Broadway star, but since he can't dance or act, he's had to settle for being a rehearsal pianist. He's abroad this spring and it makes him sad that he won't be able to see the best musical ever to hit Stanford. Joseph has also always wanted to win a Tony for best composer. Thanks to God, coffee, the cast, the staff, AD, TY, and all at home. </p>

<p><b>
Theo Polan</b> (Assistant Producer) is a freshman thrilled to be working on his first show with Ram’s Head.  His work last year producing The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged) landed him a seat at the 2005 Tony Awards.  Unfortunately, the show received no awards (or nominations, for that matter).  If they introduce a category for best collegiate musical revival, Theo is sure the amazing staff and cast of Cabaret would win it.
</p>
<p><b>
Stephen Dorsey</b> (Assistant Producer) is a sophomore planning to major in Economics, and hopefully (cross your fingers) will declare this quarter. This is his first involvement with Theater and he has enjoyed his experiences thus far. He is also involved with other student groups, including: Black Pre-Biz Society and "Stanford Spotlight," a entertainment/news program on SCBN-TV. He would like to thank everyone who has supported "Cabaret" and say ENJOY THE SHOW!!!!
</p>

<p><b>
Allison Portnoy</b> (ASM, Right) has enjoyed her first show at Stanford. She is proud to have quickly joined the ranks of sketchy rehearsal staff, and it’s only going to get sketchier as she looks forward to doing many more Ram’s Head productions in the future. She’d like to thank the amazing cast and crew of Cabaret for giving her this incredible experience. 
</p>

<p><b>
Gabby Randle</b> (ASM, Left) is a freshman with no idea what her major is going to be. This is her second Ram's Head show. She would like to thank the rest of the rehearsal staff for making her time on Cabaret tons of fun and the cast for being so easy to work with. 
</p>
<p><b>
Chelsea Vargas</b> (ALD) is a sophomore, probably majoring in Earth Systems.  She dove in to lighting for this year's Original Winter One Acts with no drama or tech related experience of any kind.  She's working hard to remember where exactly downstage left is and would like to thank Ram's Head and the cast and staff of Cabaret, and especially Storm for sharing his wealth of knowledge.
