<h2>ACT I</h2>

<b>Scene 1:  The Cheezy UP WITH STANFORD! Opening Extravaganza</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><i> Multiple spotlights swirl around and on stage as curtain opens and
we hear the jaunty UP WITH STANFORD! theme.  Fly in some of those red
centennial flags.  Stage left there is a podium typically arrayed.  Set is a
replica of the Stadium Spectacular set with metal pyramid jungle gym things.
One has a projection screen in it.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Typical announcer's voice:  Stanford students, faculty, alumni, and our
visiting friends from the Naval Accounting Office, welcome to the ONE HUNDREDTH
event celebrating the Stanford Centennial!  Yes, this is the one hundredth time
we have gathered together to flog that proverbial dead centennial horse and
remind ourselves that Stanford is indeed 100 years old!<p>
<p>
<i>As the announcer speaks, enter the UP WITH STANFORD! dancers wearing bright
red shirts, those great centennial visors and the obligatory white pants.  Some
enter from back of auditorium jogging with high knees, some proudly waving
Stanford Centennial flags, and some cartwheeling from either side of the stage
- in other words, they're way too happy to be alive.</i>  <p>
<p>
TAV (stands for typical announcer's voice):  AND NOW. . . It's time to boogie
down with that fun-loving, zany yet clean-cut group of rambunctious youngsters,
that's right folks,  the UP WITH STANFORD! dancers, in their rousing rendition
of STANFORD YOU'RE THE BEST AND YOU'RE ONE HUNDRED YEARS YOUNG! <p>
<p>
<i>They sing in joyous chorus:</i><p>
<i>(During the song, we see slides on the screen depicting many happy scenes
around Stanford:  hugging and smiling students at the Post Office, giving a
Prof. flowers as he hands over a paper that says &quot;A+&quot;, people saying &quot;after
you&quot; at a keg, happy hashers serving a lobster.  Slides change to pictures from
a family vacation--Grand Canyon etc.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Song:  &quot;Stanford, You're the Best!&quot;</b><i></i><p>
<blockquote>
Stanford, you're the best!<br>
Stanford, you're the best!<br>
Stanford, you're the best!<br>
And you're one hundred years young!<br>
<p>
You're better than all the other schools<br>
Because they're not the best (and you are!)<br>
And they're not one hundred years young (but you are!)<br>
Stanford you're the best<br>
<p>
<i>(starting soft and low at first, gradually building in a stunning crescendo.
. .)</i><p>
<i></i>Hey Stanford you're the best!<br>
Hey Stanford you're the best!<br>
Hey Stanford you're the best!<br>
</blockquote>
<i>(They part and freeze in one of those incredibly theatrical yet idiotic
tableaus )</i><p>
<i></i><p>
TAV:  Now give a big Stanford Centennial welcome to our esteemed master of
ceremonies, Ted Koppel!!<i>( Ted is lowered in on a swing)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>UP WITH STANFORD! dancers break into spontaneous song:</i><p>
<p>
DANCERS:  Hey, Ted,  you're the best!<p>
<p>
TED:  Thank you.<p>
<p>
DANCERS:  Hey Ted,  you're the best!<p>
<p>
TED:  You're too kind<p>
<p>
DANCERS:  Hey, Ted,  you're the best!<p>
<p>
TED: <b>SHUT UP!</b>  <p>
<p>
<i>UP WITH STANFORD! dancers look stunned and shuffle away</i><p>
<i></i><p>
TED:  (<i>Ted looks pretty haggard - he has M.C.ed a few too many Stanford
events, hasn't he?)  </i>Welcome again to the100th Centennial celebration
event.  You might remember our first centennial event which took place back,
well, let's see that must have been<i>(reflects)  </i>a long, long time ago.
And now a look into Stanford history (<i>cheezy clock sound fx). </i> The
Marguerite Purple Line was established in 1891 as a means of carting the . .
.uh. . .big-boned Jane Stanford <i>(slide of her)</i> to Taco Bell for her
daily Mexi Melt.  <i>( b/w slide of Taco Bell)</i>.  The influence of Jane's
runs for the border can be seen in Stanford architecture even today.  <i>(Slide
of mem-chu with a banner reading &quot;'59-cent Fajitas&quot;)</i>  The purple line grew
over the years--adapting to ever-advancing technology <i>(slides horse and
buggy, zeppelin, a model T, a Pinto, B2 bomber, the real bus with Rudy at the
helm).</i>  We're proud to have with us tonite a member of this well-oiled
transportation machine.  She's also the only remaining member of the Stanford
Community who has yet to speak at a Centennial event.  And her name is ....
<i>(checks notecard)</i>...Rudy.  Rudy. . .tell us what you do!<p>
<p>
RUDY:  <i>(an old woman, a bit disoriented)</i>  Well, I've been driving the
Marguerite Purple Line for 50 years now.  We go down there near the Shopping
Center and loop around and then we go up there and then we go back around, you
know.  But you gotta watch out for them bicycle riders cause they don't stop
for nothing.  So you kids out there better slow on down because one day when
I'm not lookin' I'm going to hit one of you and then I'll feel real bad, cause
you'll be dead.<p>
<p>
TED.:  Alright!  So Rudy, how do you feel about Stanford being 100 years old?
<p>
<p>
RUDY:  Well I think that's just fine.  I'm 84.<p>
<p>
TED.:   Thank you very much Rudy. That was quite illuminating.  And our last
special guest--you know her from her video store classics Jumpin' Jack Flash
and Thief--Whoopi Goldberg. <p>
<p>
WHOOPI:  Damn!  I didn't go here or nothin'.  Shit!  G'Night everybody.<p>
<i>(fake applause soundtrack---stops abruptly)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>TED:  And now for our Grande Finale.. <i>(drum roll)</i>...The
Centennial Lite-Brite Spectacular! <i>(dramatic music, swirling spotlights,
three hunched-over roadies in black outfits form the number 100 with their
centennial-insignia lite-brites, to be demonstrated later)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
TAV:  And remember, just because the Centennial is over, that doesn't mean the
fun is over.  XTV will show continuous reruns of the celebration for the next
100 years.  So until the Bicentennial, for Ted, Whoopi, and Rudy, goodnight.
<p>
<p>
<b>Scene 2:  cAL ANON</b><p>
<b></b><i></i><p>
<i>(group of cAL ANON members (DIRK, MIKE, and HELGA plus a couple others) on
folding chairs wearing blue and gold hospital smocks)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>DOCTOR: Welcome to this week's meeting of CAL Students Anonymous.  Good
morning everyone.<p>
<p>
GROUP: Good morning, Doctor.<p>
<p>
DOCTOR:  I first want to tell you that I think we're making excellent progress,
aren't we?  Today we're going to have another sharing time so I want you all to
be honest with yourselves and remember that we're all in this together, O.K.?
Before we start I want you all to say a big Cal Anon hello to our new member.
Why don't you introduce yourself to the group, Dirk.<p>
<p>
DIRK: (<i>wears a smock and holds a football)  </i>It's not Jerk, it's Dirk!<p>
<p>
DOCTOR: <i>(calmly)</i>  I said Dirk, Dirk.<p>
<p>
DIRK: Oh.  Hi, my name is Dirk and I'm a recovering Cal student.<p>
<p>
GROUP: (<i>unenthusiastic)  </i>Hi, Dirk.<p>
<p>
DIRK:  I played footbal for Cal for four years.  I graduated last year and we
(<i>pause)  </i>never won a Big Game.<p>
<p>
DOCTOR: <i>(soothing) </i> Ohhhh.  Don't be so hard on yourself, Dirk.  You
<u>almost </u>won once. <i>(Dirk whimpers) </i> In fact, if you pretend that
the game ended twelve seconds earlier, Berkeley <u>did</u><i> </i>win!<p>
<p>
DIRK: <i>(shudders pathetically)  </i>It was a bad call, he shouldn't have made
that call.  We need to play it over, we have to play them again.<p>
<p>
DOCTOR: Play who again, Dirk?<p>
<p>
DIRK: STANFORD, OK?  <p>
<p>
DOCTOR:  That's just fine.  You're beginning to discover your anger. I'm very
proud of you, Dirk. <i>(She puts her hand on his shoulder as he shakes
violently. Startled, the ball bobbles out of Dirk's hands. As the ball bounces
away he panics and chases after it.) </i> <p>
<p>
DIRK:  Omigod! Fumble! I can't let Stanford win <u>again</u>! <i>(He falls on
the ball, recovers it, and then leaps to his feet. At this point, Dirk should
appear totally nuts.  He yells as he runs off stage in a Heisman pose,
stiff-arming a few group members on his way out. His yell dies away as if he
has fallen out of a window.)</i><p>
<p>
DOCTOR: <i>(looks offstage to see what has become of Dirk,)  </i>I told them to
keep that window shut.  <i>(shet urns to the group and raises her voice in
order to speak to Mike, who has moved his chair a good distance away from the
group and is also facing away from them)  </i>Mike, you seem distant. Would you
like to tell us what you're repressing?<p>
<p>
MIKE: I told you before, I'm FINE! <p>
<p>
DOCTOR: Please, Mike, I'm a professional. You're hiding behind that &quot;fine&quot;
aren't you?<p>
<p>
MIKE: <i>(unsure) </i> I suppose you're right, but I mean, just because I
rhjkeumhlakmdh....<p>
<p>
DOCTOR: What are you trying to say Mike?<p>
<p>
MIKE: Just because I rushedjkaljkl......<p>
<p>
DOCTOR:  Rushed what?  Come on Mike, go with it.  Go with it.  Let everything
out.<p>
<p>
MIKE: <i>(Letting it all out)  </i>Just because I rushed the field and they
won...<p>
<p>
DOCTOR:  Who won, Mike?<p>
<p>
MIKE: STANFORD, OK? I'm such an asshole!!!<p>
<p>
DOCTOR:  That's just fine.  We feel much better about ourselves after admitting
that, don't we Mike?<p>
<p>
MIKE: <i>(vehemently)</i>  No!<p>
<p>
DOCTOR: That's just fine.  You're beginning to come to terms with your
inadequacy.  Helga, would you like to share anything with the group?<p>
<p>
HELGA: Well, it all started four years ago when I opened my mailbox.  There was
a letter in there.  But...it wasn't big. <i>(motions big)</i>  It was small.
<i>(motions small).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>DOCTOR:  Who was the letter from, Helga?<p>
<p>
HELGA: From stanford<p>
<p>
DOCTOR: Pardon me?<p>
<p>
HELGA: STANFORD, OK?!<p>
<p>
DOCTOR:  That's just fine.<p>
<p>
HELGA: <i>(getting caught up in her story)</i>  So I had to go to  Berkeley.
But I found out there was an Axe Committee there.  And then I thought to
myself, &quot;I'll take the axe away from Stanford and I'll keep it and they can't
have it back, yeah, revenge!&quot;<p>
<p>
DOCTOR: What happened then, Helga?<p>
<p>
HELGA: <i>(sad)</i>  We never got the axe.  Never. <i>(happy)</i>  So I found
my own.  (<i>pulls out an axe) </i><p>
<p>
DOCTOR:  Helga, let's put down the axe, OK? <i>(Helga starts waving axe around.
The other cAL ANON members scoot their chairs away from her and eventually get
up and exit with their respective chairs.)  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
HELGA: <i>(psychotically)</i>  Give em the axe, heh, heh, the axe, heh, heh,
the axe...etc. <p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>DOCTOR:  My God, how could this session get any worse? <i>(Yell leaders
enter from stage right)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
YELL LEADERS: Give `em the axe, the axe, the axe! Give `em the axe, the axe,
the axe!   Give `em the axe!   Give 'em the axe!   Give `em the axe!   Now!<p>
<p>
YL#1: <i>(clapping)</i>  axe axe axe axe axe<p>
<p>
YL#2: <i>(slapping her)  </i>Shut up, Lisa<p>
<p>
YL#1: axe.<p>
<p>
YLs:  <i>( raise up large lettered cards to spell AKS) </i> Give us an A!  A!
Give us an K! K!  Give us an S! S!  What's that spell???!!!! <b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>YL#3:  Wait, what?<p>
<p>
YL#4:  Oh, um, wait, I knew this . . . <p>
<p>
YL#2:  Oh, oh, oh, its . . . shit.<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
HELGA: <i>(running between them) </i>AXE! <i>(all YLs run off screaming, except
YL#1)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>YL#1:  Oh, right.  Thanks! What's that spell? Axe!  <i>(realizes HELGA
is holding a lethal weapon, runs off, chased by Helga, who does not completely
leave).</i><p>
<p>
<b>Scene 3:  Word, it's the P.C. Hammer Scene.  </b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>HELGA:  <i>(returns to centerstage.  She is alone, weilding her
axe.  Smiles sweetly, progressively becomes more psycho.  But careful guys,
don't overdo it.  It's important the audience follows what she says.) </i>  Ah,
sweet revenge is finally mine.  Stanford will suffer under the wrath of MY axe
now.  Next, to find and chop down the Stanford Tree!  Timber!  <i>(Laughs
maniacally.  Speaks as if to a pet)   </i>Here tree!  Here little tree!  Death
to all trees!  Long live styrofoam and other non-biodegradable products!<p>
<p>
<i>Loud siren sounds and red and blue lights sweep across the stage as if there
is a police car nearby.  We love you, fabulous lighting designer.  P.C. Hammer
and two members of the P.C. Police enter.  No one is dressed in spandex or
lycra half-shirts.  You cannot see anyone's flesh.  It is not P.C. to have
scantily dressed women and therefore it does not belong in this scene.  They
should look like POLICE.</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b></b>P.C. Hammer:  Yo!  (<i>Silence)  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>HELGA:  Who are you?<p>
<p>
P.C. Police #1 (<i>who happens to be an amazing dancer)</i>:  This is P.C.
Hammer.<p>
<p>
P.C. Police #2 <i>(who also happens to be an amazing dancer):</i> And we are
the P.C. Police.<p>
<p>
P.C. Police #1:   We heard you say you gonna kill some trees?  <p>
<p>
P.C. Police #2:  Check it out, that's not P.C.  <p>
<p>
P.C. Hammer:  You can't say this.  (<i>cue music)</i><p>
<p>

Chorus: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br>
P.C. Hammer:   You Can't Say This<br>
Chorus:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br>

woman rides her bike onto stage, sets it on its kickstand, and locks the wheel
to the body of the bike with a Krypton lock.  She exits.  Superman runs
heroically onto stage.  He gets close to the bike and then doubles over,
groaning - repelled by the lock.  He limps off.</i><p>

<i></i><b>Scene 4:  A Cappella Scene</b><p>
<p>
<i>Scene:  Front of red.  We see a hausfrau type woman.  Her Archie Bunker
husband sits in a La-Z-Boy watching T.V.  There is no singing at this
point.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
MILDRED:  Bud, are you gonna mow the lawn today? <p>
<p>
BUD:  Not now.  I'm watchin' my show.  This is the one where Lace and Nitro
stomp some people royal. . .oooh, that was a good one.  I'll mow it tomorrow
afternoon, Mildred.<p>
<p>
<i>Suddenly, in the background we hear faint strains of a cappella music
(doo-wop, scat stuff, etc.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
MILDRED:  Bud, Bud, they're back!  Did you hear that?  I don't understand--we
sprayed for a cappella groups just last month.<p>
<p>
<i>BUD gets out of his chair and peeks behind the curtain.  He is nearly run
over by two speeding a cappella groups, shoo-be-dooing across the stage in
different directions, and off the stage.  (picture scurrying mice).  One group
(Fleet Street) in tuxedo vests sing a few bars from &quot;Conjunction Junction.&quot;
Mixed Company sings &quot;My Momma Told Me, You Better Shop Around.&quot;  BUD grabs the
phone (did we mention, there's a phone?) and says--</i><p>
<i></i><p>
BUD:  Operator, give me the exterminator. . . Hello, listen, we've got a
cappella groups.  Can you get a guy?. . .yeah. . .thanks.<p>
<p>
<i>Enter exterminator, looking like a your normal everyday Orkin guy.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
MILDRED:  That was fast.  <p>
<p>
EXTERMINATOR:  Hear you got a problem with a cappella groups.  <i>(One of them
runs across the stage.  Women in bad dresses, sing a few bars of &quot;Working in a
Coal Mine&quot; off key.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
MILDRED:  EEEK!<p>
<p>
<i>EXTERMINATOR goes to the curtain, lifts it up and many, many groups
scurry</i> <i>out singing.</i>  <i>Mendicants singing &quot;Brown eyed girl&quot; and
Everyday People singing &quot;Everyday People.&quot;  Mildred jumps up on the chair and
screams EEEK!  A.C.'s run amok.  They mess up the house and blow pitch pipes
frequently.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
EXTERMINATOR:  Well, here's your problem, you got a nest of `em behind this
wall here.  Nasty things breed like rabbits.  Seems like there's a new group
every week.  Nooo problem.  I'll take care of this in just two shakes of a
lamb's tail.  (<i>He blows a pitch pipe and sings)</i>  Wim-o-Way, Wim-O-Way. .
. .(<i>a cappella groups, led by Talisman, pick up the song and follow him out
offstage whilst skipping. . . .except one group (you can decide which one, we
prefer fleet street) , which remains led by a scat singer)</i><p>

boom etc. <p>
<p>
<i>(re-enter the exterminator with enormous can of Raid)</i><p>

EXTERMINATOR:  I hate it when I have to do this.  <i>(Sprays the singer.
Singers cries out then falls.  Other group members look at the EXTERMINATOR,
obviously pissed off)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>EXTERMINATOR:  (<i>intimidated by angered boppers,</i> <i>into a walkie

control problem here, I repeat requesting back up.<p>

MARLIN: Welcome once again to Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  I'm Marlin
Perkins. (<i>Slide:  a map of Wilbur Field)  </i>Today we'll be exploring the
farthest reaches of Wilbur Field, penetrating into the very depths of Bimbus
Omigodus territory.  These creatures may be better known to you by the more
common terms: Debbi, Kelli, Cyndi, Traci, Kiki, (<i>slides of various
lycra-clad, party pic chicks, some in sororitity sweatshirts)  </i>well you get
the general idea.  Joining us for this adventure, is expert in Greek tribal
life and monosyllabic communications, Jane Goodall.<p>

JANE:  Omigod!  Hi Marlin!  How's tricks?<p>
<p>
MARLIN:  Jane, I see you've mastered the native tongue of the Bimbus
Omigodus.<p>
<p>
JANE: (<i>speaking normally) </i> That's right, Marlin, and as you'll see when
we run the film, I have also learned much of their primitive ways and relations
with the neanderthal-like group Dudus (<i>say Dude-us) </i> Phallocentrus

enters the sisters stop and stare at her.  Total silence)</i><p>

JANE: (<i>to audience) </i> As you can see by their behavior, these creatures
are hostile to anyone not belonging to their group.  I will now try to get
myself accepted as part of the group by imitating their clothing and behavior
patterns.  <i>(Jane wips off her safari outfit and is clad in lycra; she takes
her hat off to reveal a pony-tail on the top of her head. She approaches the

I look okay, and sound okay <i>(sorority voice)</i>  I <i>am</i>  okay!!!!!!<p>

KIKI: <i>(approaching Jane)</i>  Cute outfit!  Did you get it at the Limited?
Hi!  I'm Kiki!! <i>(stretches out her hand,  Jane tries to shake her hand but

<i></i>TRACI:  Great tan!!!  I <i>love</i>  your earrings!!!  Rilly!  Hi!  I'm
Traci!!! <i>(same move)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>JANE: <i>(to the audience)</i>  What you're seeing is a behavior pattern
known to those of us who study it as the two second hand-off.  The two second
hand-off is the result of a superstition among the Omigodus that the handling
of a non-initiate for an extended period of time might lead to the introduction
of the forbidden<i> </i>meaningful dialogue.  Surprisingly, one can learn
almost everything possible about these creatures during these brief
interactions.  For instance, I've ascertained that Traci is actively involved
in beach culture and is amused by small shiny objects.  And, that's about it.<p>

KELLI:  Debbi, can you put my hair in a french braid???<p>
<p>
DEBBI:  Yea!  Do you have a scrunchy I can use?  <p>
<p>
KELLI:  Yea!  It's in my purse next to my hairspray!!!<p>
<p>
DEBBI: <i>(Looking in Kelli's purse) </i>  <i>Where</i>  did you get this
sugared-grapefruit lip-liner????<p>
<p>
KELLI:  Macy's - Clinique was having a free gift!!!!<p>
<p>
DEBBI:  Sweet!!!<p>
<p>
JANE: <i>(to the audience) </i> What you're seeing now, is a complex pattern of
interaction that will eventually culminate in an extended period of grooming.
This behavior pattern can sometimes last for hours.  Now, to further study the
mating habits of this group with the Dudus Phallocentrus group Marlin and Jim
will attempt to track one of the Bimbus Omigodus from the air and then tag her
as she enters Dudus territory.<p>
<p>
<i>(From overhead we hear the sound of approaching hellicopters.  Jane exits.
The group of sorority sisters run as a group (herd-like) to various corners of
the stage.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>MARLIN V.O.: <i>(with the choppy voice helicopter effect that Tony
like</i> s so <i>much)  </i>The sound of the approaching helicopter appears to
frighten the herd and induce them to run around in a frenzy, not unlike the one
you saw last week in the distantly related wildebeests.  Jim will attempt to
isolate one of the Omigodus.<p>
<p>
SISTERS: <i>(screaming and running around) </i>
Omigoooooooooooooooooood!!!!!!!<p>
<p>
<i>[a net drops from the ceiling and captures a lone Omigodus.  Helicopter
sounds cease, and Marlin and Jim come on stage]  </i><p>
<p>
MARLIN: Jim will now undertake the dangerous task of tagging the Omigodus.<p>
<p>
JIM:  Me?<p>
<p>
MARLIN:  <i>[enthusiastically]</i>  YES JIM!  Go get her!<p>
<p>
<i>[Jim approaches the lone bimbus(Didi)  and removes the net.  She is
dazed.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
DIDI:  What happened?<p>
<p>
JIM:  Hey, isn't that an SAE?<p>
<p>
DIDI:  WHERE?! <i>[turns around.  Jim takes the opportunity to attach a helium
baloon to her ear.  He takes a ridiculously large tracking radar and begins to
track two feet behind her.]</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>JANE: We will now be able to track Didi as she enters Dudus
Phallocentrus territory and prepares to take part in their ancient mating
rituals. If you listen closely, you'll be able to hear their simple, yet
charming mating calls.<p>
<p>
<i>(enter various frat boys in neanderthal loin cloths and frat
sweatshirts)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>BIFF: <i>(approaching (not deproaching, yet) Didi)  </i>Hey babe, wanna
come up to my room and have sex? <p>
<p>

<p>
DIDI: (<i>laughs then glares at him, slaps him, and walks away)</i><p>

VARIOUS BROTHERS: Ooooh.<p>

BRAD: Hey dude, what's the deal with Thor?<p>
<p>
THOR:<i>(floundering on the ground-obviously drunk)</i>  Help....I've fallen
and I can't hook up.<i>(Tad and Brad help him off)</i><p>
<p>
JANE:  Apparently, not all Dudus have mastered the age-old mating ritual as
well as the tribal leader, Biff.  But with practice and conscientious brushing,
Thor will someday be able to objectify women with the poise and dexterity of
the elders. <i>(sorority voice)  </i>Buh-Bye!!!!!! <i>(she exits)</i><p>

MARLIN: <i>(Tad and Brad are still helping Thor off stage)</i>...And like the

<b>Scene 6:  The CIV Scene</b><p>
<p>
<i>(Lights out.  Then, piercing the darkness, a lone spotlight;  and in it, a
lone freshman.  He is wearing conspicuously flashy tennis shoes, maybe a
jogging outfit, a baseball cap.  He is Bo.  He stands in the spotlight looking
bewildered.  Scratches his head, etc.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>VOICEOVER:  This is Bo. (<i>Bo waves)  </i>Bo is a freshman.  (<i>Bo
looks proud)  </i>Bo will do well, unlike hundreds of other freshman.  Because
BO KNOWS CIV! <i>(appropriate musical flourish goes here.  Bo takes off sweats
to reveal track shorts and a numbered T-shirt.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(Enter two cast members with microphones, looking like sportscasters.  Let's
call them Howard and Laurie.  There is also a woman in a lab coat and a referee
with a striped shirt who blows his/her whistle)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>HOWARD:  And it's a fine day here on the campus as Bo warms up for his
first CIV championship.  Let's watch him as he gets ready for the first
round.<p>
<p>
(<i>Bo has his back to the audience.  He appears to zip his pants and hands a
cup to the woman in a white lab coat)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>LAURIE:  And he looks ready, folks, as long as Diane doesn't find
anything in his drug test.  You know folks, in preparation for the CIV finals,
Bo hasn't slept in three days.  How do you feel, champ?<p>
<p>
BO:  Well, Howard in spite of medical evidence, I don't find that lack of sleep
has had any negative effects on me as a CIV student (<i>BO wigs out)  </i>Get
them off me, Howard!  Get them off!  Sorry.  (<i>Bo jogs away)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>LAURIE:  Bo's first event, of course, is Suck Up to the T.A.  And it
looks like he's ready.<p>
<p>
<i>(enter a guy in a bike helmet with Birkenstocks and straps around the bottom
of his pants to keep them from getting grease on them)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>T.A.:  I'm Richard Pedantic, your TA.  I'm a PhD candidate in postmodern
Peruvian feminist literary philosophy. I also like Chinese food, macrame, and
men who aren't afraid to cry.<p>
<p>
BO:  Hey, Richard - can I call you Richard? - I was wondering if you'd mind
helping me on my paper.  I mean, you know so much.  <i>(sound effect of crowd
going &quot;Ooooh&quot;).  </i>I really think you're better than the professor.  In fact,
I think you should <u>be</u> the professor.  <i>(sound effect of crowd going
&quot;Ahhhhh&quot;).  </i>Love the bike helmet.  It really makes you look intellectual.
Golly, you must get all the women.  <i>(clapping sound effect).</i><p>
<p>
<i>(Judgs hold up signs reading 9.0, 8.9, 9.6, . . . and 3.0 (did we mention
there were judges?)  Howard gives Bo a Gatoraid)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>HOWARD:  How are you doin' champ?<p>
<p>
<i>(Bo continues to jog in place as he drinks his Gatoraid.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>LAURIE:  Great scores on the brown-nosing -- with a low score from the
ASSU senator - you just can't please the experts.  And there he goes to the
all-important, Say Something Intelligent in CIV Section Competition.<p>
<p>
<i>(Bo is now at a table with other students)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>TA:  OK.  Who has something to say about Homer?<p>
<p>
STUDENT AT TABLE:  <i>(Makes the Homer sound (that sounds like &quot;dohhhh&quot; from

<p>
MARSHA:  Well, my high school teacher said . . (<i>ref blows whistle)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>HOWARD:  And that's a clear disqualification. (<i>Marsha exits)</i><p>

<p>
VANILLI:  . . .handed down through the ages. . .<p>
<p>
MILLI:  . . .which speaks to us today as much as it did to the ancient
Greeks.<p>
<p>
TA:  Very good.  And also from the back cover of Cliff's Notes.  (<i>ref blows
whistle)  </i>Milli, Vanilli, you are both disqualified for plagiarism.
(<i>they leave)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>BO:  I really shouldn't say anything.  I've only read it twice.
(<i>everyone on stage is impressed, &quot;oooooooh&quot;)</i><p>
<p>
HOWARD:  Very sneaky!  That should win it for him hands down.  Now he's  got to
say awake through that lecture.  Good luck, Bo.  <p>
<p>
<i>(Bo is in a single chair in front of a lecturn)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>PROF:  The Illiad is a timeless epic, handed down through the ages,
which speaks to us today as much as it did to the ancient Greeks.  But before I
begin my discussion of Homer's masterpiece, I have asked distinguished Human
Sexuality Professor Katchidorian to share with you his own alternative reading
of the text. (<i>enter Kat)</i><p>
<p>
KAT: Thank you.  For centuries, the accepted translations of the Illiad have
all asserted that Achilles' fatal weakness was his unprotected heel.  An
analysis of the original manuscript, however, shows that the greek term
&quot;schlongai&quot; has been misconstrued to mean heel.  In fact, the word &quot;schlongai&quot;
refers to another, more sensitive area of the anatomy.  This brings up a
veritable slew of questions regarding how the work should be interpreted.  For
example, one must consider how the hero was suspended when he was dipped as a
boy into the river Styx.  <i>(exit.  Bo, wide-eyed, gets up and jogs in place a
little.)</i><p>
<p>
LAURIE:  And he's still with us!  How do you feel, Bo? <i>(He gives a thumbs
up)  </i>This could really set the pace for the rest of the competition.  Now
it's a race against the clock as Bo must attempt to turn in his paper on time.
(<i>ref fires a pistol.  A duck falls)  </i>And he's off!<p>
<p>
<i>(Bo is running across the stage clutching a stack of papers.  At the far end
of the stage is the Professor)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>LAURIE:  Making good time so far . . . but wait!  His path is blocked!<p>
<p>
<i>(Bo is blocked by the class of 1912 with walkers and canes and lawn
darts).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>HOWARD:  Look out, Bo!  It's the graduating class of 1912!  And they're
playing lawn darts!<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>BO:  Hey, isn't that Art Linkletter?  (<i>Taking advantage of the
distraction, Bo runs for it)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>LAURIE:  And he's free -- but . . . Look out!  It's a bunch of tourists
looking for the Quad!<p>
<p>
<i>(Bo escapes and hands his paper to the Prof.  He is surrounded by the
Cheering Multitude and handed a big trophy by Howard) </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>HOWARD:  Great run, Bo!  Any comment?<p>
<p>
BO:  Well, Howard, I guess it just comes naturally, since CIV is my favorite
class.  I really love it.  <i>(The Cheering Multitude is suddenly silent.  Jaws
drop.  Loooks of disgust.  Laurie snatches back the trophy)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>LAURIE:  Bo . . . . you don't know diddly.<p>
<p>
CHEERING MULTITUDE:  Yeah!<p>
<p>
LAURIE:  You're not supposed to love it, Bo.  You just do it.  Let me show you

<i></i><p>
<i>(scene - onstage.  Whyte Plaza, with that white gazebo thingie in the
background, very medieval, dirt, chickens, straw, etc. etc.  Some folks are
playing hacky sack.  Many people wandering around at this Medieval Fayre,
vendors are selling chickens, pig parts, bread, and tie-dyes.  People are all
in dirty rag-like attire.  Lots o' dirt.  Near the white Gazebo Thingie have a
sign that says &quot;&quot;Big Joust Today at Whyte Plaza.&quot;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>MINSTREL <i>(female)</i>:  <i>(wandering through Whyte Plaza window
shopping, carrying lute ostensibly over shoulder.  Notices the audience and
steps forward to begin his tale)</i>  Ah! Gentle assembly, 'tis good fortune
which has brought us together, for I, the town minstrel, have a tale to tell.
Hark!  Listen ye well as the tale of the DEAN'S FIRST DEED<i> </i>unfolds
before you.  <i>(Trumpet do-do-do-do)</i>   Why, here comes the herald now. .
.<p>
<p>
HERALD <i>(reads big scrolly thing)  </i> Hear ye! Hear ye!  Gather 'round for
news of the rrrrealm! Lady Jean of Fetter, Dean of the Castle Gate has left the
kingdom. In other news, tonight is the first of four solid days of rrrecited
poetry by Master Geoffrey Chaucer in the Coffee Hovel.  <i>(rolls up the
scroll)  </i>And now, for today's festivities, 'tis a joust!  <i>(general glee
and chants of &quot;Joust!  Joust!&quot; as the contestants drive out in their golf carts
-- a SURE driver and a conspicuously Cal-looking fellow)  </i>In the red cart,
we have the top student in the Castle University, Prince Escort of SURE
<i>(yeahs)</i>.  In the blue and gold cart, we have Sir Weenie of Cal
<i>(boos)</i>.  To the winner, the Axe!  <i>(cheers)</i>  To the loser, the
home game version of the Whyte Plaza Joust and a season's supply of Mutton
flavored Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco Treat.  <i>(shaking of medieval keys by
the crowd)  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>MINSTREL:  Unfortunately, attendance at Big Joust was at an all-time low
due to the high ticket cost and the bubonic plague.  <p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>WOMAN:  <i>(they speak in Monty Pythonesque British accents)</i>
Haven't seen your wife in some time, is she well?<p>

MAN:  She died of The Plaque.<p>

MAN:  Why yes.  Cowell got back the test results.  They told her she had plaque
and the next day she was dead.  <p>

WOMAN:  Bad teeth, eh?<p>
<p>
MAN:  No.  But she had big nodules on her neck and her hands were all black.<p>

MAIDENFORM:  Hark!  I hear the singing of the Lady of Lake Lag.<p>
<p>
LADY OF LAKE LAG:  <i>(shrieks then speaks in a New York accent)</i>  People?
Are you listening?  So what's your problem.  Okay, so you got a stone with an
axe in it.  You got no Dean.  So you figure the new Dean is the one who can
remove the axe and save the kingdom.  No big whoop.  I gotta go hear Chaucer
talk at the Coffee Hovel. Later. <i>(exits)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
ALL:  We thanketh thee, oh, Lake Lag Lady!<p>
<p>
KNIGHT RIDER:  But alas!  We knoweth not the new Dean.<p>
<p>
MINSTREL:  The news spread.  People came from far and wide to vie for the
position of Dean of the Castle Gate.<p>

<i>(general grumbling)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
HAGGY TYPE:  Let the peasant try!  You never know. . . <p>
<p>
<i>(after a few unfruitful tugs, Jim Montoya pulls out the Axe, throwing off
his rags to reveal some elegant outfit.  Revelatory music and lighting.)</i><p>

WEENIE:  Not so fast, I said if I can not have the axe, no one can.  And no one
shall!  <i>(the Weenie brandishes a sword.  Gasps from the crowd, &quot;it's Sir
Weenie,&quot; etc.) </i><p>
<p>
<i>(The Weenie makes a showy sword play intended to intimidate the Dean.  He
ends in a thrust.  Following this, the Dean walks over and knocks away Sir
Weenie's sword with one blow)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>SIR WEENIE:  Shit.<p>
<p>
JIM MONTOYA:  <i> (a la </i><cite>The Princess Bride</cite><i>)  </i>My name is
James Montoya.  You killed my student.  <i>(indicates the dead ex-Jouster)
</i>Prepare to die.  <p>
<p>
HERALD:  <i>(approaching the DEAN)  </i>Excuse me sir, but an act of capital
punishment might not be the best thing for your image.  <p>
<p>
JIM MONTOYA:  Shucks.  You're right.<p>
<p>
HERALD:  Any other ideas?<p>
<p>
JIM MONTOYA:  All right Sir Weenie, I shall not smite off your head, but you
are banished to Berkeley instead. <i>(trumpet fanfare)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
MINSTREL:  And thus Sir Weenie of Cal was banishéd forever across the
bay.   Not one to wallow in his successes, Dean Montoya quickly called the
first meeting of his committee, the Monastic Order of Admissions.<p>
<p>
<i>A group of monks files in, possibly chanting. They huddle around Montoya,
football-style, as he prepares to speak.</i><p>
<p>
JIM MONTOYA: My faithful admissions committee, I have but one question.
<i>(dramatic pause)</i> What... is your quest?<p>
<p>
MONKS: <i>(strongly)</i> To find the finest possible students anywhere!<p>
<p>
JIM MONTOYA: <i>(smiles proudly)</i> Just what I wanted to hear. I'm off to
Wyoming in search of high school valedictorians. Godspeed! <i>exits</i><p>

call it, &quot;Big 'Ol Booty of Which I am Proud&quot;.<p>
<blockquote>
My bootie is nothing like the sun.  But it's still pretty big,<br>
Half a league, half a league<br>
My bootie is like a loaf of bread.  But you wouldn't want it buttered.<br>
My bootie is not time's fool, <br>
Though rosy lips and cheeks <br>
Within its bending sickle's compass come,<br>
Sitting on things, <br>
Panties full of butt.<br>
Men are the cause of all evil and pestilence.<br>
Thank you very much.<br>

<i></i><b>Scene 7:  The Quadfather, Part I </b><p>
<p>
<i>The Scene:  A Foggy Dock.  Stacked Crates and Barrels.  A drop painted like
a warehouse comes down.  We hear a foghorn.  A sign is flown in which reads,
&quot;The Quadfather&quot;, as Godfather music plays.  Enter DonWeenie, a Godfather
look-alike; Ramona, his right hand woman; Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi--persons
of hench on one side of the stage, wearing trench coats and fedoras.  Enter
Domino, a hired Weenie thug, from the other side.  Ramona leaves Don Weenie's
side to greet Domino.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
RAMONA: <i>(whispering)</i>:  Why can't the fat man swim with the fishes?<p>
<p>
DOMINO:  Because there's no water in the lake and he has a job at Green.
<i>(They nod or go &quot;aahhh&quot; in recognition and kiss each other on both cheeks)
</i><p>
<i></i><p>
RAMONA:  Greetings, Domino.  Don Weenie is pleased that you are here at this
clandestine meeting. <p>
<p>
DOMINO:  It is always a pleasure to serve the Weenie family, Ramona.
<i>(foghorn)  </i>Excuse me.  <p>
<p>
RAMONA:  Are you sure no one has followed you here, my friend?<p>
<p>
DOMINO:  Of course no one has trailed me to this dark, foggy waterfront.<p>
<p>
<i>(Sudenly we hear the Scooby Doo theme.  The trap door flies open, and
Shaggy, followed by Velma and Fred, climb out.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
VELMA:  Where are we?<p>
<p>
SHAGGY:  <i>(voice cracking)  </i>Like, I don't know, Velma.  <p>
<p>
FRED:  It looks pretty dangerous.  Maybe we should split up.  Daphne and I will
go this way.  Wait, where's Daphne?<p>
<p>
DAPHNE:  <i>(voice from under the stage)</i>  Down here, Fred.<p>
<p>
VELMA:  Jinkees, guys.  Daphne's got her foot stuck in Scooby's mouth.<p>
<p>
SHAGGY:  Zoinks, that's not her foot.<p>
<p>
SCOOBY:  <i>(under the stage)</i>  Rooby rooby roo!<p>
<p>
FRED: Danger-prone Daphne does it again.  <p>
<p>
RAMONA:  Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi too, take care of those meddling kids!<p>
<p>
<i>(persons of hench open fire with absurdly large Uzis.  The meddling kids run
in place for a few seconds with their arms straight ahead of them(like they
always do on TV) and then run offstage)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
RAMONA:  As you know, we've tried for years to ruin Don Don and the Stanford
family.  We put that smell in White Plaza.  We're the ones who wedged the stick
up Paul Biddle's ass.  We built Manzanita Park.  Domino, Don Weenie has made
you a crucial part of his final plan to destroy the Stanford family.  <p>
<p>
DON WEENIE:  Domino, I don't have to tell you how important you are to
us--<i>capiche</i>?<p>
<p>
RAMONA:  He says, &quot;I don't have to tell you how important you are to us,
understand?&quot;.  <p>
<p>
DOMINO:  <i>(finding Ramona slightly absurd)</i>  Thank you.<p>
<p>
DW:  We know you'll make the right choice, <i>andiamo</i>.<p>
<p>
RAMONA:  He says, &quot;We know you'll make the right choice, hovercraft&quot;.<p>
<p>
DOMINO:  Hovercraft?<p>
<p>
DW:  Would you like some espresso, <i>teste de gatso</i>?<p>
<p>
RAMONA:  He wants to know if you want something to drink, you percussive llama.
<p>
<p>
DOMINO:<i>(to the DON)</i>  No, thank you, Don Weenie.  Just tell me what to
do, baby.<p>
<p>
DW:  As you know, the Stanford quadfather Don Don is stepping down.  His cousin
Vito is coming from Sicily to take his place at the head of the Stanford
family.  <p>
<p>
DOMINO:  So where do I fit in?<p>
<p>
RAMONA:  Patience.  Now, the Quadfather has never seen his cousin Vito.  We
want you to take Vito's place, and do everything you can to bring Stanford to
its knees.<p>
<p>
DOMINO:  But what about the real Vito?<p>
<p>
DW:  <i>(laughs wickedly, yells offstage) </i> Show Domino what about the real
Vito.  <p>
<p>
<i>(Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi go offstage to get the real Vito.  They return
with Vito, who is tied up inside a green recycling barrel--only his head sticks
out through the lid of the bin. The recycling bin is wheeled in on a dolly.
Vito struggles to free himself from the cement.)</i><p>
<p>
DW:  I'm afraid that by this time tomorrow, cousin Vito will be just another
Dr. Pepper can.<p>
<p>
REAL VITO:  You'll never get away with this, you <i>(flash slide of this word
while Real Vito mouths blasphemous obscenities:) </i>!!@#&amp;$.  The
Quadfather will put a stop to you and your fiendish plot.  Stanford will never
fall to the Weenie family!<p>
<p>
DW:  Enough!  Take Vito away!  <i>(Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi, take Vito away.
We hear the music for &quot;I'm a Pepper&quot; in a sad, minor key)</i>  Goodbye, Vito.
No deposit, No return. Hahahahaha <p>
<p>
RAMONA:  Vito is expected to arrive at Stanford tomorrow.  You will pose as
Vito and become the new Quadfather, then we can destroy Stanford from within.
A word of warning--your job will not be easy.  You must fool the entire family,
including Don Don.  Don't blow your cover.  He's very clever, that Don Don.<p>
<p>
DOMINO:  I will be more clever.<p>
<p>
RAMONA:  That's the attitude.  Just think of it, Domino! We'll squash
that...country club!  We'll be better than them.  They'll be our slaves!
(growing realization with mounting music)  We won't have to take as many drugs!
We won't have to spraypaint anymore Rodin sculptures to make us feel better
after we lose!   Our football players can start learning to read!<p>

Stanford sweatshirts.  They are somewhat nervous.  They are walking together
and conversing.  </i><p>

MARIA:  I'm so happy, Tony.  <p>
<p>
TONY:   You're happy?!  Just imagine how happy I am.  My first date at Stanford
and it's with the Quadfather's niece!<p>
<p>
MARIA:  Oh stop!  Honestly, I'm a little nervous, but going on a date's not
that big a deal, really--is it, Tony?<p>

wears the same clothes from Quadfather One, so's people will recognize him.

POPE:  Maria, do you take this man to be your date for the evening?  To engage
in witless banter, to attend obscure cultural events which interest neither of
you, to feign fascination and nod attentively, and to reveal his innermost
secrets to your friends at the Coffee House tomorrow?<p>
<p>
MARIA:  <i>(scared and confused)</i>  Yes?<p>
<p>
POPE:  And do you, Tony, take this woman to be your date for the evening?  To
refrain from using the word &quot;chick&quot;, to abandon all your real friends for the
faintest prospect of frantic sex, to carry with you that &quot;lucky&quot; condom you got
in White Plaza freshman year?<p>

TONY:  I. . .I do.  <p>
 <i>(the audience cheers and reaches out to shake their hands.  The happy
couple is still baffled)</i><p>

<p>
TONY:  <i>(kissing up to get in good with the family) </i>So, Mr. Uncle Vito,

<p>
DOMINO:  Sure.  I lived in Berkeley for 25 years. . .10 years. . .5 years. . .

MARIA:  So, Uncle Vito, what have you been doing in Sicily all these years?  <p>
<p>
DOMINO:  I have been a humble ravioli farmer with absolutely no connections to
anyone of the Weenie family.<p>
<p>
<i>(enter real Vito--disheveled and frantic)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
VITO:  Not so fast!  I'm the real Uncle Vito, and this man is but a poor
imposter planted by Don Weenie to bring down the Stanford family!<p>
<p>
<i>(the crowd gasps)</i><p>
<i></i><p>

BOCEEPHUS:  I'm twenty.<p>

Sicily that I have not had the chance to see you grow up to be the charismatic
and self-assured man that stands before me.<p>

VITO:  Don't listen to him!  He's a hired gun for the Weenie Family.  I myself
only narrowly escaped recycling at their evil hands.  Don Don, I am your true
cousin.<p>
<p>
DON:  <i>(pauses in thought.)</i>  I will decide this matter and my decision
will be final.<p>
<p>
ROBIN:  But Donald, you've never met Vito.  You know almost nothing about him.
How can you ever tell him from an impostor?<p>
<p>
DON:  The answer is obvious, my dear Robin.  Clearly, the impostor is . . .  <p>

chest, sucks in his cheeks, rolls back his eyes, and makes fish noises. But he

DON:  <i>(Recovering.  He was only pretending to die.) </i> Aha!  Only a Weenie

<b>Scene 3:  Poetry for Physicists</b><p>

SETTING: <i>three separate stations of a physics lab in front of drop or red.
Three groups of physics majors, all wearing safety goggles, and white lab
coats.  They are all busily at work at their stations.  One group is watching a
ball as a student drops it over and over again.  Another group is measuring a
rod with various techniques.  The third group is rolling a ball back and forth
on the table.  A white-lab coat -wearing-and-clipboard-carrying prof resembling
&quot;Doc&quot; from </i><cite>Back to the Future</cite><i> enters. </i><p>

Prof: &quot;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old time is still a-flying.&quot;
<i>(everybody opens notebooks and scribbles frantically)</i> And it's time to
begin another lab session of &quot;Poetry for Physicists.&quot;  But before we begin, are
there any questions? <p>
<p>
Clive: Well, actually - <p>
<p>
Prof:  Good.  Let's begin with a quirky problem proposed by some cretin in
lecture today. . . Open your texts to page 584. <i>(barks)</i>  Quickly!<p>
<p>
<i>(class struggles frantically with their unwieldy textbooks.)</i><p>

Clarence. (<i>no pause between &quot;page&quot; and &quot;Clarence&quot;)</i><p>
<p>
Clarence: Hah? Uh. &quot;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not
travel both And be one traveler - &quot;<p>
<p>
Prof:  That's enough Clarence!  Now, class, tell me. Taking Kepler's laws of
planetary motion, if we have two roads diverging at some unknown angle Y from a
frictionless inclined plane, how would we calculate torque the sine of the
complement of angle Y, the angular momentum, i.e. angle X ?<i>(they scribble
furiously)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Becky: 3.14 ! <p>
<p>
Prof: Well, Becky, no.  That's a crude approximation of pi.  <p>
<p>
Mildred: <i>(interrupting) </i> Excuse me, but shouldn't the third term in the
quadratic function be <u>negative</u>?<p>
<p>
Prof: <i>  </i>Yes, Mildred.  Exactly! <p>
<p>
Mildred:  <i>(She scribbles excitedly as she speaks.  Class looks confused).
</i>And with a few adjustment here and here.... <i>(dramatically raising paper
she has just scribbled on)  </i>By jove, I've got it!  <p>
<p>
Class:  Ahhhhh!<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Mildred:  <i>(rising ecstasy)  </i>The modulation of the forces takes on
a wave-like pattern!  <p>
<p>
Prof:  Yes! We must measure the amplitude of the poem!  And SLINKY!<p>
<p>
<i>(Student#1 and student#2 reach under a table and pull out one of those
20-foot-long springs that are used (at least in MY high school) in physics
classes.  They run to either side of the stage with it, holding each
end.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Professor:  WAVE THE SLINKY!<p>
<p>
Student #1:  (<i>yells in affirmative</i>) SLINKY!  (<i>The two students
continuously flick the slinky so as to produce a wave.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Professor:  <i>(cresendo to frenzy)</i>  Look at that amplitude!  As you
can see, the resonance of the stanza when measured against the linguistic
pressure produces what is known as a phrase shift!  IT'S ALIVE!! <p>

<b>Scene 4:  The Boat Dance Scene</b><p>
<p>
<i>Scene:  On a boat.  It is a boat dance. </i><p>
<i>Across the front of the stage extends a two-foot-high curved flat
establishing that this is a boat.  There is a matching flat halfway back to
create a closed space.  Flown-in mast and awning.  There are white party lights
hung on the ropes which are attached to the top of the mast.  A rope ladder
goes up to the balcony stage left.  Scenery in background with water, horizon,
etc.  Sounds of water abound.</i>  <i>Students are on the deck in party
attire--women in formal dresses, men in tuxedos or just wearing ties if this is
more financially feasible.  Opening introductory nautical-type music.  Students
are milling around.  A foghorn sounds across the starry night.  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i> </i>R.A #1 MICHAEL: <i>(wearing huge bright orange life vest, very
perky)</i>   Is everybody aboard?  O.K.!  Ahoy!  Alrighty!  Welcome to the
<i>[Name of Dorm with Block Tickets]</i> Boat Dance!  I hope you all are having
a super time!<i> </i> <p>
<p>
<i>(student staggers to the back flat, hangs over it and proceeds to heave
ferociously, but the RA continues speaking)</i>   <p>
<p>
MICHAEL: (<i>continuing)  </i>Tonight we're lucky to have as our musical guest
Gregor, playing Czechoslovakian polka music on his accordion!<p>
<p>
<i>(enter Gregor with accordion.  He is the biggest cast member and wears a
fake moustache and a funny hat.  (Make sure the hat is really funny)  He laughs
heartily and then gives it a good squeeze.)</i><p>
<p>
JIM: When does the real music start?<p>
<p>
R.A #3 YOLANDA: Jim - we don't need eurocentric popular music to have fun.  We
are a dorm that appreciates music from ALL cultures.  Right Gregor?  C'mon
Gregor, give it a good squeeze!  <i>(Gregor laughs heartily again and gives it
another good squeeze.  For the next couple lines, Gregor mimes playing his
accordian and a few of the boat dancers lock arms and do a folk dance using the
grapevine step.  This is not very central, so keep it mellow.)</i><p>
<p>
BILL: Hey, <i>[name of a real female RA from the previously mentioned dorm with
block tickets]</i>, where's the keg?<p>
<p>
RA 2:  <i>(Real R.A. from the dorm with block tickets.  Also wearing large
orange life vest)    </i>Now, Bill!  <i>(approaches Chuck speaks to the whole
group)  </i> We don't need alcohol to have fun.  Tell them, Isaac.  <i>(Enter
Isaac, the bartender from the Love Boat, to a few bars from the Love Boat
theme)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
ISAAC: <i>(Isaac points his fingers at RA #2 in the appropriate Love Boat
opening style)  </i>You said it, man.  We can all get down, without Res Ed
&quot;gettin down&quot; on us!  <i> </i>How about a cranberry juice and seven-up with a
twist?  Now that's a party, dig?<p>
<p>
MICHAEL:  <i>(joining in with Isaac and pointing, too)   </i>And on the lower
deck are Calistogas and finger sandwiches for the whole crew!  There are also
some dark corners down there where you can all smooch!<p>
<p>
R.A. #2:   Michael, don't you remember R.A. training?  We don't need sex to
have fun!  We have shuffleboard!  Bill, did you bring the pucks?<p>
<p>
BILL: No dammit, I didn't.  Polka, fruit juice, deck games... Hell, I wanted
adventure at sea!  <p>
<p>
MICHAEL: Bill, we can have fun without using profanity.<p>
<p>
BILL: <i>(continuing)</i>  I want danger, adventure, those big callouses you
get from climbing ropes all day, the salt air filling my lungs.  I want to live
life on the edge! <i>(RAs look confused)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>YOLANDA:  But Bill, that wouldn't be prudent.  You could hurt
yourself.<p>
<p>
<i>From offstage back left is moved on a rolling flat of a pirate ship so it
appears to be approaching the boat dancers.  It has a flag with a skull and
cross bones and other related pirate accessories.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>BILL: <i>(still continuing) </i> I want wooden limbs, a gold tooth, and
a parrot on my shoulder!<p>
<p>
GLENDA <i>(seeing the ship approach)</i>: Pirates!<p>
<p>
BILL: Exactly!<p>
<p>
CAPTAIN HOOK:  <i>(Cannon goes off)  </i>Arrr!  Prepare to be boarded ye scurvy
weasels! <p>
<p>
BOAT DANCERS:  Zoinks!  Jinkees!  Yikes!  Pirates!<p>
<p>
R.A.. #2:  Didn't we lock all the outside doors?<p>
<p>
PIRATE:  Batten down the hatches, drop the anchor, prepare to come about, swab
the deck!<p>
<p>
CAPTAIN HOOK:  Mateys, take the wheel and secure the fiesta deck. <i>(general
pandemonium on stage as pirates try to tie up various students)  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>YOLANDA: Excuse me, this is a closed party.  Do you have a valid
Stanford ID?  No keys, please.<p>
<p>
HOOK <i>(looks confused)  </i> No, Ma'm, we're pirates, see, we're boarding
your ship illegally, that's what we do. Arrr! <i>(pirates drag around various
prisoners)</i><p>
<p>
TWELVE-ANKLED ROBERTA:  What should I do with this one Cap'n?<p>
<p>
HOOK: Hang him from the highest yardarm!<p>
<p>
PIRATE: Keel haul him!<p>
<p>
ONE EYED JACK:  Shave his belly with a rusty razor! <i>(eww.  Pirates carry out
these orders, general confusion)</i><p>
<p>
MICHAEL:  R.A. #2, What does the RA handbook say about Pirates?<p>
<p>
RA#2: <i>(reading)  </i>Pirates: Often called crazed marauders of the high
seas.  Res Ed prefers &quot;emotionally challenged and socially maladjusted people
of the ocean&quot;.  If you encounter Pirates, attempt counseling techniques; but
beware of hooks.<p>
<p>
HOOK: <i>(brandishing hook in a helpful demonstration) </i>Arrr!  Somebody take
care of these rascals!  Where be One-Eyed Jack and Three-Armed Pete? <i>(a few
nameless pirates enter and tie all three RAs to the mast. RAs protest
vehemently, but to no avail. One-Eyed Jack and Three-Armed Pete enter rolling
kegs of rum)  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>PIRATE: Arr!  There they are Cap'n. Whatrya doin' mateys?<p>
<p>
ONE-EYED JACK: Grog for the crew!  Two barrels of rum from our ship! <i>(boat
dancers cheer, despite being tied up.  RA's glare at them from the mast)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>MICHAEL: You can't do that!  We won't tolerate your grog here.  This is
an alcohol-free boat dance!  We can have fun without alcohol!<p>
<p>
PETE:  Well, go right ahead.  We'll have fun <u>with</u> alcohol!  Arrr!!
<i>(chugs, then passes a bottle to the tied up boat-dancers, they all start
singing yo ho ho, etc.)</i><p>
<p>
BILL:  <i>(approaches pirates)  </i>Excuse me, <i>(pause so he becomes the
center of attention)  </i>my name is Bill.  I'm a Modern Thought and Literature
major and I'm not very excited about my present career oportunities at the
Jiffy Lube.  I was wondering if you have any openings on your ship?  I have my
resume with me here. <i>(hands resume to pirate)</i>  I have a good G.P.A. and
I love working with people.<p>
<p>
HOOK:  Can you plunder?<p>
<p>
BILL:  Well, I was on the ASSU Council of Presidents . . .<p>
<p>
HOOK:  You're hired.<p>
<p>
BILL:  Gosh thanks!<p>
<p>
PIRATE: You realize that now you'll have to lose a body part to be a real
pirate.  We have peg legs, hooks, eye patches - what body part do you use the
least?<p>
<p>
BILL:  <i>(looks at his groin) </i> Well, I go to Stanford so that would be . .
. my left hand. <p>
<p>
PIRATE: Don't look so glum, Bill. Just remember pirates get groovy 	outfits and
a great dental plan!<p>
<p>
HOOK:  And you know, Bill, one of the best things about being a pirate is that
you can make anyone you want walk the plank.  Why don't you give it a try?<p>
<p>
BILL:  <i>(Recovering from his morosity)</i>  Gosh, OK. <i>(Bill gets
Gregor)</i><p>
<p>
GREGOR:  <i>(still miming playing his accordian, happy)  </i>Ho ho ho (<i>he
goes over the edge)  </i>hooo sheeeet!!! (<i>We hear the last moan of his
accordian)  </i><p>
<p>
HOOK: Arrr!  You're getting the idea, laddie.<p>
<p>
BILL:<i>(getting into it)</i>  Hey, I kinda like this!  Let's do it again!
<i>(He scans the stage and spots the RAs still tied to the mast)  </i>Arr!
You're next my little rascally residential rogues! <p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>MICHAEL: <i>(as BILL leads them to the plank)  </i>Let's talk about
this, Bill.  You're only doing this because you don't like yourself, you know!
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>YOLANDA: <i>(trying a different approach)</i>   Bill, we can have fun
without killing others at sea! (<i>The R.A.'s fall into the water, the Pirates
cheer) </i><p>
<i></i><p>
HOOK: Arr!  He's a mean one!<p>
<p>
BILL: This calls for a celebration!  <p>
<p>
ISAAC:  <i>(pointing, as usual)</i>  All right!  Break out the sparkling
cider!<p>
<p>
HOOK: Apple juice is for Weenies!   Real pirates drink barrels o' rum.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
PIRATES: Yo ho ho. <i>(much cheering from everyone else)</i><p>
<p>
BILL: Alright!  Someone turn on some music! <i>(Yaz, or some other Europop
comes on. The boat dancers bop.   Pirates attempt to dance briefly, then give
up.)</i><p>
<p>
HOOK:  Arrr.  What is this Europop shit?  We want some real music.  Boys? <p>

<i></i>HILARY:  Well, you did make a backup, didn't you?<p>
<p>
TROY:  I think I need some air.<i>( he gets up and walks to centerstage and
apeaks to the audience)  </i>What the hell is a backup? <i> </i>I've only been
here two weeks.  Already, I have no idea what is going on in chemistry.

anything like the Stanford I had envisioned when I was back in high school.<p>
<p>
<i>The opening bars of &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn&quot; blare from the PA.  As Troy recounts
his pro fro glories, they are acted out around him on stage. The music fades
(softly) as he narrates.  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
TROY: <i>(Voiceover)  </i>It was the winter of 1990, and I had just sent off my
Stanford application. I was confident that my two years as Slavic Society
Sergeant-at-arms would establish me as a leader, and I knew the videotape of my
oboe concerto would put me over the top. And then, one bright, Southern
California day, it came. (<i>fly in a couple palm trees)</i><p>

<i>Troy eagerly rips it open, and Dean Jean floats in from offstage, grasps
Troy's hand, and looks deeply into his eyes. The music starts up again as Dean
Jean narrates. </i><p>

DEAN JEAN: It was the winter of 1990, and I had just received his Stanford
application. I was confident that his two years as Slavic Society
Sergeant-at-arms established him as a leader, and the videotape of his oboe
concerto made me quiver inside. And then, one bright Northern California day, I
accepted him. Tremendous, Troy! <i>(They exchange a high-five and she prances

of the Stanford family. They took me to a dorm where I met the resident

that when I'm a Stanford student. Later on, Kevin got me into a really great

FELLATIO:<i>(interrupting, aside to Beef)</i>  EBF?  Thou hast fallen for a
veggie! (<i>they continue to mime a discussion of this while focus turns to
Libida and Moonbeam)  </i><p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  <i>(to Libida, please don't overdo it)  </i>O Beef!  His manly
strides doth set my face aflush.  Those supple lips do set mine own a-quiver.
My heaving bosom doth abandon me of breath. . . .O!  Me so horny!<p>
 <p>
LIBIDA:  <i>(to Moonbeam)</i>  Alack, Moonbeam, calm thy tempestuous fires.
Prithee, hold thy peace.  Thy Beef is but a Delt...  He hangeth out with Greek
maidens and recycleth not.<p>
<p>
MOONBEAM and BEEF <i>(get it, simultaneous asides to their companions) </i>
Prithee, BE GONE!!  <p>
<p>
<i>Fellatio and Libida exit separately to let the lovers have their space and
to let them do their own thing. Sappy romantic music.</i><p>
<p>

MOONBEAM:  How now, cow?  Mieuuuuuu I say.<p>
<p>
MILKY WHITE:  Zounds, forsooth, mieuuuuuuuuuu.  Alack, mieuuuuu.  <p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  Ahhhh, mieuing beasts of bovinity.  Their melodious mieulings
inspireth the heart to romance.  <p>
<p>
BEEF:  Yeah.  <i>Exit Milky White</i><p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  <i>(aside to audience)</i>  Oh, what must be done? Alas, I do think
I love him.<p>
<p>
BEEF:  What?  What mean you love you me?<p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  It's an aside, you dipshit.<p>
<p>
BEEF:  O! Sorry!  <i>(covers his ears, starts singing)</i>  I cans't not hear
thou, la la la la la, I hear you not, la la la la.<p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  Ay, Beef, <i>(he does not listen.  he is la-laing)</i>.  Beef!  <p>
<p>
<i>They embrace.  Cheezy romantic music swells.  Beef swells, too. They are
about to join lips, when....The Kitchen Manager of EBF enters., in tie-dyed
Shakespearean costume, a chef's hat, dredlocks, and sunglasses.  Music stops
abruptly.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>GARBONZO:  Moonbeam!  Why are you not in the kitchen?  It is thy turn to
be head cook and boil the lentils for supper!  The co-op awaiteth!<p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  Biteth me, Garbonzo!  See you not that I am occupied? <p>
<p>
<i>Dramatic music, portending doom.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>GARBONZO:  <i>(draws dagger)</i>  The cooperative shall not go hungry
whilst thou playest tongue sushi with a Delt! <p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Garbonzo lunges toward Beef, who draws his own dagger, and stabs Garbonzo.
</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>GARBONZO:  <i>(stumbling offstage)  </i>Curse the day!  I am slain!  But
before I die, I will jog the three miles back to the house and bring word of
this grave injury to the other foresters.  Thou hast not seen the last of the
longhairs, <i>(disgustedly)</i> <u>Delt.</u><p>
<u></u><i></i><p>
<i></i>MOONBEAM:  Now where werest we?<p>
<p>
<i>They begin to join once again, when....Football Coach Dennis Green (or
someone who looks vaguely coach-like) in Shakespearean costume, carrying a
clipboard and wearing coaches' shorts, enters.  He bloweth a whistle.  The
music stoppeth.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>DENNY:  Beef!  Why art thou not i' the field? <i>(sees Moonbeam, and is
visibly shocked)  </i>Scrumpest thou with a granola!   Why don't you find a
nice yell leader?<p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  Begone, Coach!  I am Beef's primary receiver now! <p>

<u></u>DENNY:  I'll have your scholarship for this, Beef!  <i>(to Moonbeam)</i>
 Thou hast not seen the last of me, thou biodegradable bong-blower!<p>
<p>
<i>The coach exits.  More romantic music, bigger 'n better.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
BEEF:  Nothing more shall interrupt us, my radiant Moonbeam.<p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  O Beef!  Grip me!<p>
<p>
<i>They move toward each other  and their faces get closer and closer and
closer until they KISS!  A nice little one from which each turns dreamily to
the audience and sort of floats away.  Suddenly, trumpets play charge theme a
la a baseball park. </i> <i>From the sides of the stage come Foresters and
Deltoids in war formation. Delts are led by Dennis Green; Foresters are led by
a bloody Garbonzo, closely followed by a dude with SEAS mugs hanging off him
everywhere. Foresters advance to &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot;  and Deltoids advance to
stadium charge tunes.  The two alternately play and then melt into each other
(ask Doug). All are in modified Shakespearean garb.  Delts wield football
weapons; EBFs wield produce.  Fellatio and Libida are among their respective
ranks.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>SEAS GUY:  (<i>to football coach)  </i>One of your offensive players
hath stabbed our kitchen manager!<p>
<p>
COACH:  Your tawdry tie-dyed trollop has kept Beef from his workout!<p>
<p>
SEAS GUY:  You big dumb galloot!<p>
<p>
COACH:  Tripped out bean freak!<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Big carefully-choreographed fight scene ensues, with the music alternating
between gridiron trumpet fanfares and trippy psychedelia.</i>  <p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  O Beef!  Our once verdant pastures are stainéd by the blood
of neighbors.<p>
<p>
BEEF:  Fie on such carnage!   <i>(Walks into the middle of the fray, attempting
to break it up.) </i>  Halteth!  Ceaseth!  <p>
<p>
<i>Everyone stops; they all stare in stunned silence and in anticipation.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
BEEF:  My friends, why dost thou here squabble and shed the blood of thine own
brothers and sisters when there looms an imminent invasion of the warlike
weenies of the north country? <i>(Picks up a bloody apron and kneepad.) </i>
Open thine eyes and see that we all bleed Cardinal Red!<p>
<p>
<i>The SEAS Mug dude bashes Beef with a mug.  Beef falls.  The following lines
are enacted very quickly.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>FELLATIO:  What is this I see?  My friend dead?  Then I die!<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
MOONBEAM:   What?  Beef limp?  Then I fall!  <i>(she swoons)</i><p>
<p>
LIBIDA:  My gentle sister hath fallen!  Would that the gods might strike me
down that I may rest with her!  <i>(She falls)</i><p>
<p>
BEEF:  <i>(gets up, sees Moonbeam's dead body)  </i>Alack the day!  My sweet
love dead!  O happy dagger!  Kill me! <i> (he stabs himself)</i><p>

LIBIDA: <i>(recovering from her swoon)</i>   What is this I see?  Everyone
dead?  May the gods strike me again!<p>

FELLATIO <i>(rising)</i>:  No, no Libida, I do yet remain!<p>
<p>
LIBIDA:  O!  Glad tidings!   I die of joy! <i>(swoons again with joy)</i><p>
<p>
MOONBEAM:  Wait!  Look!  We all live!<p>
<p>
OUR HEROES:  O, we live!  Joy and huzzahs!<p>
<p>
EVERYONE ELSE:  O, they live!  Joy and huzzahs!<p>
<p>
<i>They all start to hippie-dance to happy mandolin music.</i><p>
<p>
FELLATIO:  (to Libida) If our friends can find love and happiness together,
what is to stop <u>all </u>of us, including you and I, dear Libida, from living
together in peace and harmony?<p>
<p>
LIBIDA:  O happiness!  Let us all swap spit!<p>

<b>Song:  &quot;Beef 'n' Beans&quot;  <i></i></b><p>
<blockquote>
<b><i></i></b>BEEF:   Moonbeam, I've just kissed a girl named Moonbeam<br>
<p>
MOONBEAM: When the Delts first came to 353<br>
We saw no way to live cooperatively<br>
They'd use styrofoam cups and leave their lights on<br>
And dump all their beer bottles onto our lawn<br>
I was sure that they'd ruin our home by the lake<br>
With the smells of their shoes, their sweat, and their steak<br>
But then I saw Beef, no more bean curd for me <br>
My romantic diet would not be meat-free<br>
<p>
BEEF: When first I saw her in the EBF garden<br>
My flabby resolve, it started to harden<br>
Tripping on mushrooms and kissing the sky<br>
She smoked so much dope I could smell her brain fry<br>
I never thought she would go for a  jock<br>
While growing her beans, tie-dyeing her socks<br>
Composting garbage and recycling cans<br>
To Wednesday night music by Dead cover bands<br>
<p>
BOTH: Ooooooooooooooooh, baby <p>
<p>
BOTH:  But all our preconceptions are blow'n in the wind<br>
We stare and we giggle for hours on end<br>
Talkin' 'bout places where we'd like to screw<br>
Doin' the stupid shit young lovers do<br>
Meat's not much different from curd after all<br>
And tie-dying jock straps, we both had a ball <br>
Our love for each other's tremendously large<br>
Like the bulls in Pamplona, we're ready to charge <br>

<b></b>(<i>Scene opens--it is a game show.  Arr!  The host is your friend and
mine, the late Burt Convey.  For the backdrop, buy colored streamers made of
plastic or cellophane (something more durable than paper) and attatch them next
to each other to form a multi-colored gaudy curtain.  Fly in an arching silver
sign at the front of the stage that says '$25,000 College Bowl Pyramid Jeopardy
Jackpot Wad!'  The action should take place in the front half of the stage.
The Weenies are on stage left and Stanford is on stage right.  Burt has his own
podiun center stage.  Behind him is a scoreboard that is digital (ha ha ha.
Well, you told me to dream big).  There are also signs dropped in behind him.
A big dollar sign, a question mark, a pink flamingo, etc.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>VO: Its the $25,000 College Bowl Pyramid Jeopardy Jackpot Wad!  And
here's our host the late Burt Convey!<p>
<p>
BURT: Thank you.  Welcome to the $25,000 College Bowl Pyramid Jeopardy Jackpot
Wad!  Let's meet today's competitors.  Representing Stanford are Joe Einstein,
Mindy Copernicus, Bob Confucius, and Dana Plato. <i>(they come running on stage
in Family Feud fashion)</i>   And representing the University of California
Miles McWeenie, Gertie McWeenie, Dirk McWeenie, and Asshole in a Bear Suit.
<i>(enter Cal students as above) </i> You all know the rules, let's play the
$25,000 College Bowl, ah Tac Dough Wheel of Family Feud Connection. . . .<p>
<p>
VOICEOVER:  <i>(helping out Burt)  </i>Pyramid Jeopardy Jackpot Wad! (<i>cheezy
start-up music) </i> <p>
<p>
BURT:  We'll begin now.  The clues for the first question are
&quot;umm, err, and duh&quot; <i>(sound of buzzers) </i> Cal! Dirk.<p>
<p>
DIRK:<i>(struggling)</i>  Ummm, errrr, duuuh <i>(buzzer)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>BURT: Nice try.  Stanford?<p>
<p>
JOE: Things a Cal student might say?<p>
<p>
BURT: Right-o Joe!  The next clues are:  Recover on-side kicks, win Big Game,
get a college degree. <i>(buzzers)  </i> Cal! Asshole in a bear suit! <i>(ABS
stares at Burt.  Jeopardy music)  </i>Uh, Asshole in a bear suit, do you have
an answer?<p>
<p>
<i>(Everyone stares transfixed as ABS gets up and paces a lot in that
oh-so-lovable way of his.  Suddenly, a two-ton block of cheese falls from the
sky and crushes the bear.  Much cheering ensues) </i><p>
<p>
BURT: Stanford, do you have an answer?  <i>(buzzer)</i>  Dana?<p>
<p>
DANA:<i>(in a husky demonic voice)</i>  There is no Dana, only Zool.<p>
<p>
JOE:<i>(aside to Burt)  </i> Dana hasn't been the same since the hold-up.<p>
<p>
BURT: Okay.  Zool?  The clues again are Recover on-side kicks, win Big Game,
get a college degree...<p>
<p>
DANA/ZOOL: Things a Cal football player can't do?<p>
<p>
BURT:  Right you are Zoolie!  And as we move into the jeopardy round the score
stands tied at Stanford 10, Cal 10.  Teams! Have you picked your
representatives? <i>(Miles and Mindy come up to the middle.  Burt introduces
them.)  </i>Well, it looks like Miles McWeenie will be representing Cal.  Miles
is a drug-scarred shell of his former self, he was once an engineering student,
but now he sells hallucinogens to unsuspecting Stanford senior lecturers.  Say
hello Miles!<p>
<p>
MILES: Mello hiles.<p>
<p>
BURT: And representing Stanford is Mindy Copernicus.  Okay.  Our first category
is math.  The answer is five..<i>(buzzers)  </i> Miles?<p>
<p>
MILES: (definitively) The number of flashbacks I've had since the show
started.<p>
<p>
BURT: I'm sorry, that's incorrect. <i>(buzzer)  </i>Mindy?<p>
<p>
MINDY: <i>What is</i>  the number of flashbacks he's had since the show
started?<p>
<p>
BURT: That's correct!  Remember Miles, your response must be in the form of a
question.  Mindy, since you answered that question correctly, you get to pick
the category for the lightning round.  The categories are aquatic life, small
fuzzy animals, and photosequential non-linear metaquizzical game theory.<p>
<p>
MINDY: I'll pick aquatic life, Burt.<p>
<p>
BURT: Okay, there are thirty seconds on the clock, whoever has the most points
at the end, wins! <p>
<p>
VOICEOVER:  Duh<p>
<p>
BURT:  We'll begin...now!  This small puffy fish is served as a delicacy in
Japan. <i>(buzzer)</i>  Miles?<p>
<p>
MILES: Blowfish!<p>
<p>
BURT: Correct.  When it feels threatened, this small fish puffs up to five
times its normal size. <i>(buzzer)</i>  Miles?<p>
<p>
MILES: Blowfish! <p>
<p>
BURT: That's correct.  What does Mrs. Trout do? <i>(buzzer)</i><p>
<p>
MILES: Blow fish!<p>
<p>
BURT: That is also right.  Hey, who's been tampering with my cards?
<i>(buzzers)  </i>Mindy?<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>MINDY: Blowfish!<p>
<p>
BURT: Wrong! <i>(buzzer)</i><p>
<p>
MILES: <i>I</i>  was tampering with your cards, Burt!!<p>
<p>
BURT: That's right, Miles, it was you!  Ten points! <i>(At this point hundreds
of Cal fans rush the stage, they yell things like, We Won! There is much chaos.
Someone punches Burt. Blowfish.)</i><p>
<p>
V.O.: Please clear the stage, please clear the stage, the game is not yet over,
etc. <i>(Chaos, chaos, chaos.  Then refs come in and calm everything
down)</i><p>
<p>
DIRK AND GERTIE: We won! We won! We're better than you! We won!!<p>
<p>
REF: <i>(with appropriate hand signals to be demonstrated by Doug)</i>  Delay
of game, Cal,  minus five points.  Personal foul, roughing the host, Cal -
minus five points.  <p>
<p>
BURT:<i>(brushing himself off)</i>  Well Miles, you answered the last question
correctly.  But due to the penalties, the score is back to Stanford 20, Cal 40
with fifteen seconds back on the clock.  The category is now &quot;Things Only A
Stanford Student Would Know&quot;.  Let's go.  The worst possible name for a suicide
prevention center. <i>(buzzer)</i>  Mindy.<p>
<p>
MINDY: The Bridge?<p>
<p>
BURT: That's correct.  It looks like a big Dick<i>(buzzer)</i>  Mindy?<p>
<p>
MINDY: Hoover tower?<p>
<p>
BURT: You're right!  It sucks! <i>(buzzer)</i>  Miles?<p>
<p>
MILES: Blowfish!<p>
<p>
BURT: Wrong! Mindy?<p>
<p>
MINDY: Branner!  Branner Sucks! <i>(5 minute delay of scene)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>(All on stage freeze for the inevitable 5 minute delay of scene, after which
the referee trudges back out.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>REF: <i>(With appropriate hand signals)</i>  Delay of scene, audience.
Penalty of one Roasted Chappie Chesnut to be assessed on the offending
parties.<p>

<i>(Two idiots in period costume, oh, say, the roaring twenties, run out to
center stage.)</i><p>

nose? <p>
<p>
IDIOT #2: Why no. How does it smell?<p>
<p>
IDIOT #1: Awful!<p>
<p>
<i>(Makes that punchline pose from Centennial Gaieties.  Howl, audience, howl.
The idiots are pulled offstage with a big hook as the VO begins.)</i><p>

<i></i>BURT: That's right! <i>(ending buzzer)</i>  Branner does suck! Stanford
wins! <i> </i>Gilgamesh, tell them what they've won.<p>
<p>
GILGAMESH VO: They've won curtains, shower curtains, pink shower curtains from
the Kennedy home, valued at over $25,000 dollars. <i>(cheering from the
Stanfords)</i><p>

<a name="version-info">Version Notes</a><p>

This script is cobbled together from a few sources, and is probably
about 90% correct with respect to the actual produced version.<p>

The main body of the script was scavenged from the Ram's Head
Macintosh hard drive.  The references to the Centennial Celebration at
the beginning date this version as being at least circa October, since
that fiasco was late September.<p>

The song <i>Renaissance Woman</i> was copied down for me by Elena
Melendez '94, who sang the Applicant solo.  But she did so four years
later, on a napkin, in about five minutes flat, while flirting with
her boyfriend, as the Coffee House was closing down, so I kind of
doubt it's complete.  It looks mostly correct though.<p>

The finale song lyrics are just from my own recollection.  I think the second
line was actually something a little less self-deprecatory, but the last verse
is absolutely correct, and most of us seem to agree it was in fact repeated
four times.  I'll have to check my videotape sometime.<p>
