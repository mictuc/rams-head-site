<p>
Oh joy, the orchestra finishes off its cute little overture.  Nice try guys,
don't feel too bad.  Now we have the Green Library Entrance/Exit desks.  Our
hero, er, uh, villain, Psychoclicker, is clicking people into Green Library...
or is he?</i><b><p>
</b><i><p>
The voiceover begins with a bell arpeggio (just like at the beginning of the PA
announcements in </i><cite>Grease</cite><i>).</i><b><p>
<p>
Voiceover:</b> Attention Students: Green Library will be closing in 4 hours.
The loan desk will be closing in 3 hours 55 minutes.  The New York Stock
Exchange closed up 14 points today in heavy trading, the American Mind closed
in 1980, and Denny's <u>never</u> closes!<p>
<b><p>
Psychoclicker:</b>  I.D.?  <i>click-click</i>  I.D.?<i>  click-click</i>
I.D.?<i> click-click</i>  I.D.?  <i>(obviously spoken) </i> CLICK-CLICK.<p>
<b><p>
Jill:</b>  Hey, you didn't click me in!<p>
<b><p>
Psychoclicker:</b>  You're wrong.  I did click you in.<p>
<b><p>
Jill:</b>  I distinctly heard you <u>say</u> &quot;click-click&quot;.<p>
<b><p>
Psychoclicker:</b>  What's the difference anyway?  <p>
<b><p>
Jill: </b>You're the clicker guy -- you click people in to the library -- it's
your job! <p>
<b><p>
Psychoclicker:</b>    <i>(Evil laugh...and he kidnaps her as the curtain opens
to a big spooky, smoky library scene, with people studying, milling around etc
in the smoke -- and thus we get a big song and dance number about how there are
weird disappearances occurring on the campus...)<p>
<b><p>
Song: </b>&quot;Weird Shit Happenin' Here&quot;<b></b></i><b><p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="intro">The Overly Specific Character Introduction</a></b><i><p>
Scene: Tableau.  That means that there are four separate scenes frozen, waiting
to happen (as soon as the lights come up on them).  The scenes are: Bianca
being threatened by two other students (Myssi and Syssi); Ingrid with a couple
of rather liberal-looking hippie types; Ralph with a stern old Stern office
woman; and Chryssi with a couple of Draw people.  Also Walter w/ harmonica at
stage center, but he doesn't have a tableau... they all come to his tableau.
Lights up on the first tableau, which springs into life, full of warmth and
vigor.  Not really, it's Bianca et al. </i><p>
<b><p>
Myssi</b>: That's it Bianca!  Syssi and I have had it with you!<p>
<b><p>
Syssi</b>: Yeah.  I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything Bianca, but
Myssi and I...hate you.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: I'm crushed.  <p>
<b><p>
Syssi</b>: Do you always have to be so sarcastic?  <p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: <i>(totally sweetly-sarcastic) </i> Ohh, I'm sorry -- am I being
sarcastic again?  I promise to try harder not to!<p>
<b><p>
Myssi</b>: There you go again!  Why can't you just be like everyone else in
Branner?<p>
<b><p>
Bianca:</b><i>(sarcastically serious)  </i>Because Branner <u>sucks</u>.<p>
<b><p>
Syssi</b>: You're such a...a...a...NONCONFORMIST!<p>
<b><p>
Myssi:</b> Face it Bianca, this triple isn't big enough for the three of us!<p>
<b><p>
Syssi</b>: Here's your stuff <i>(each of them tosses a hangerful of black
clothing to Bianca and stand shoulder to shoulder waiting for her to get out).
</i>Now get out.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: <i>(sarcastic)  </i>Thanks.  You two have been great.  And by the
way -- I replaced your birth control pills with Pez. <p>
<i><p>
(Myssi and Syssi's jaws drop and their eyes bug out.  Bianca</i> <i>walks
calmly to the center of the stage.)</i><p>
<i><p>
Next tableau:</i><p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b> <i>(meticulously folding clothing and putting it into her valise):
</i> I can't stand this anymore!  I hate the Draw!  If it were run on the
capitalist system I could have bought a better number and none of this would
have happened!  Instead I end up here in <u>Synergy</u>, rooming with a goat!
And the food -- wheat bread, wheat germ, wheat thins!  Oatmeal, oat bran, oat
burgers!  What the hell is an oat burger?!? <p>
<b><p>
Sid Synergy</b>: C'mon Ingrid, don't you realize what you are gaining by living
in a cooperative ecosystem?  You're milking cows, tilling the soil, building
fences -- you're becoming one with the environment!<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  No I'm not.  I'm becoming a farmer.  Look, if I want to become one
with the environment, I'll go to Club Med.  As for right now, I'm moving out.<p>
<b><p>
Cathy Columbae</b>: Are you sure Ingrid?  I mean, where'll you live?  What will
you eat?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: <i>(sarcastically)  </i>I'll camp out -- I'll forage for nuts and
berries -- it won't be that different from living here!  <i>(cool and
confident)  </i>But not to worry -- I have plastic.  <i>(she opens her wallet
and a long row of cards flips out in one of those plastic things; she storms to
center stage)</i>.<p>
<i><p>
Next Tableau:</i><p>
<b><p>
Stern Stern Lady</b>: Mr. Eldridge, you have listed on your damage report form
that your room had a &quot;man sized hole in the wall, &quot;a map of Australia painted
into the carpet, and that your light fixture had been replaced by &quot;a mirrored
disco ball.&quot;   We appreciate the humor, Mr. Eldridge, however listing excess
damage in advance is a violation of the <u>Fundamental</u> <u>Standard</u>!
<i>(evil chords!!!)</i><p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: C'mon lady, everybody lists excess damage on those forms!  I just
didn't want to get stuck with a huge bill at the end of the year when -- I mean
<u>if</u> I broke something <u>accidentally</u> -- you understand... don't
you?<p>
<b><p>
Stern Stern Lady</b>: Yes Mr. Eldridge, I understand.  Everybody does do it --
but <u>you</u> got caught.  And so you must serve as an example. <p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: I'm...I'm...<p>
<b><p>
Stern Stern Lady</b>:  In deep doo-doo, Mr. Eldridge, <u>deep</u> doo-doo.
I'm afraid you're out of housing.  Stern is no place for people like you.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Stern is no place for people.  Period!<p>
<b><p>
Stern Stern Lady</b>: Here's your tent, Mr. Eldridge.  Good luck!  <i><p>
(Ralph shuffles to center, dejected).<p>
<p>
Next Tableau:</i><p>
<b><p>
Debbie Draw: </b>Welcome to the Draw!  <i>(she holds out a hat)  </i>This
year's theme is &quot;Hats!&quot;<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi:</b> Hats?  No Disney?  No universal studios?<p>
<b><p>
Debbie Draw:</b> What's wrong with hats? Consider yourself lucky -- our second
choice was Dante's <u>Inferno</u>!    <p>
<b><p>
Chryssi:</b> All right, all right.  Hats is nice.  I'll draw now.  <i>(draws a
number)  </i>Oooh! <i>(she pulls the end of a roll of adding machine paper out
of the envelope: it just doesn't end -- it's really really really really long.
Huge.  Big.  So where were we?)  </i><p>
<b><p>
Debbie Draw:</b> You drew 237!   237 times 10 to the 7th!  That's <b>really
</b>bad!!!<p>
<i><p>
(XTV guy runs up)  <p>
</i><b><p>
Xavier XTV: </b> Hi there Chryssi!  I'm Biff from XTV!  You just drew the worst
number in draw history!!  How do you feel about that?<p>
<i><p>
Chryssi decks him.  Walks to center stage.<p>
<p>
The leads are now all at center stage (did I mention this is all in front of
the red?).  Walter has been sitting there all along. Lights up on center
stage.</i><p>
<p>
[DITTY:  &quot;It Sucks To Be Out Of Housing&quot;<i><p>
Walter does not sing, he just accompanies on his harmonica.  The leads do sing,
but do not accompany.  Each has his/her own verse whining about their
out-of-housing-ness.  Maybe individual chunks o' music join together.  Maybe
lyrics are like:<p>
	&quot;I never liked them anyway&quot;<p>
	&quot;Wheat thins are for Sandy Duncan&quot;<p>
	&quot;You won't catch me standing out in a field&quot;<p>
	if I stayed there much longer, I'd have congealed.&quot;<p>
	&quot;Damages, damages, damages, damn!&quot;<p>
	&quot;Two thirty-seven, sixty-four, ninety-eight... [all of Chryssi's singing is
her draw number, she continues singing throughout the whole song... it's a
</i><cite>really</cite><i> long number, eh?]&quot;<p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca: </b><i>(goes up to Walter, and says sarcastically):  </i>Enjoying the
sixties?<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b><i>(nods):</i>  Heeeey.  I'm Walter.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b><i>(sarcastically) </i><b>: </b>I'm sure you are.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  Hi, Walter, how did you get boofed out of housing!?<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>:  Housing?  They kill trees to make houses.  Bad trip.  <u>My</u>
home is wherever I put down my stuff and get in line.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Yeah, I've often felt that way.  Life: an endless series of lines,
and everyone's trying to cut ahead just so they can pay and get out.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Line?  What line might we be talking about?<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>:  The Dead.  I'm waiting in line for the Dead.  I <b>live</b> for
the Dead.  All I want from this year is to see the Dead.  <p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Oh Walter, don't be ridiculous! The Grateful Dead play in the
spring! <p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>:  I <b>really </b>want to make sure I get tickets.  See, I missed
them last year, cuz I was in Stanford in Nicaragua.<p>
<cite><p>
Dail</cite><i>y guy walks in.<p>
</i><b><u><p>
Daily</u> Guy:</b>  <u>Daily'</u>s here!  Get your <u>Daily</u>!<i><p>
<p>
The assorted characters bloodlustfully swarm around the
</i><cite>Dail</cite><i>y like a school of pirhanas and scarf 'em up.  The
frozen characters get theirs and run off.  The last few copies go to desperate
hands in the Orchestra Pit.<p>
</i><b><p>
Walter</b>:  The <u>Daily</u>.  Wow.  I've never read it.  Is it cool? <p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  No, but the columnists <u>always</u> have really stupid pictures!<p>
<i><p>
And of course, now we get the entrance of....<p>
</i><b><p>
Release Guy</b> <i>(joke:  his fingers are being singed by the hothothot
Releases)</i>:  Hot hot hot!  Release's here!  Get your Release!  It's hot hot
hot!  Hot... hah... hot!  Ow, ouch, ow!!  <i>Drops the stack in great
pain.</i><p>
<i><p>
Everyone on stage looks down from their </i><cite>Daily</cite><i> for a second,
shoots an evil glance at the Release Guy, and go back to his/her quality
journalism.  Note that the stack of Releases will remain exactly where it has
been dropped for THE ENTIRE SHOW. Perhaps they will begin to rot onstage.<p>
</i><b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Hey!  Look at this, guys!  There are four students reported
missing!<p>
<i><p>
Characters look up from their Dailys, and get a DING! lightbulb effect in
realization... except Ralph.  So it goes DING!, DING!, DING!, Clunk?.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b>:  I don't get it.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid </b><i>(patronizing and emphatically) </i>: There are four missing
students, Ralph, and four of us.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  You mean... we're going to be missing next?<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Empty spots, Ralph!  Empty dorm rooms that need to be filled with
living, breathing, thinking individuals.  In <b>your</b> case, two out of these
three might do.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  So, we go to the Res Ed office and find out the details -- let's
check it out!  Tally Ho!  <i>(Ralph marches off triumphantly)</i>.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Res Ed?  Why would we go to Res Ed to get housing?<p>
<b><p>
Walter: </b>Why not?  <p>
<b><p>
Chryssi: </b>Ralph!  Ralph!  <i>(she follows him)</i><p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>:  Don't stress.  He's on a roll.  <i>(he exits)</i><p>
<b><p>
Ingrid: </b>He's on <u>something</u>.  <i>(she exits)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: I can already tell I'm gonna <u>love</u> these people.  <i>(she
follows, too)</i><p>
<b><u><p>
<a name="resed">The Rather Evil Residential Education Scene</a></u></b><i><p>
Scene (behind the big red curtain of doom):  The Res Ed office / Supton's
workshop.  It's kind of like the office scenes in &quot;Brazil&quot;:  Fast, busy working
music excites lots of people looking very busy doing very useless things in bad
light.  Lots of phones ringing, frantic writing, virgin sacrifices, etc.
Several boxes of papers are being passed from worker to worker.  Occasionally,
someone does something with a paper or two in the box.  You know how it is.<p>
	There's a big ResEd banner saying &quot;Welcome to Res Ed -- Now Go Home&quot;. Perhaps
the audience will be able to read it.  <p>
	Somewhere downstage, a student is strapped down to a table and has mucho
electroshock paraphernalia plugged into him.  ResEd grand Puston sits down next
to him, pencil in one hand, electrodeath control  (big switch, eh?) in the
other.<p>
</i><b><p>
Puston:</b>  Good afternoon, Bob.  As you know this is the first round of R.A.
interviews.  Just sit back and relax, I'm going to ask you a few questions.
Don't worry about all these wires, and please, don't be afraid to be completely
honest.  <p>
<b><p>
Bob:  </b>Great, I've really been looking forward to this.<p>
<b><p>
Puston: </b>So, Bob...  why do you want to be an RA?<p>
<b><p>
Bob:</b>  Well, Ms. Puston, next year will be my junior year, and I'm going
unguaranteed, so I really need hous...<p>
<i><p>
Puston pulls switch... hence abbreviated as </i>
<b><i><em>BZZZZTTT!!!!!!</em></i></b><p>
<p>
	...I want to be an educator!  An educator and a role model for my fellow
students.  I feel I have a lot to offer the dorm and especially since I'm 21
now, I figure I can... <b><i><em>BZZZZTTT!!!!!!</em></i></b>... drive them up
to the city to see the opera!<p>
<b><p>
Puston:</b>  Well done, Bob <i>(now ShiskaBob). </i> Now, when did you decide
you wanted to become an RA?<p>
<b><p>
Bob:</b>  Well, I was tripping at the last happy hour the Alpha Delts had
before they lost their house... <b><i><em>BZZZZTTT!!!!!!</em></i></b><i> </i> I
mean at the &quot;Fire Within&quot; program.  I really felt the fire within, and I was
moved, really.  Let me tell you, there was this awesome frosh-babe about two
rows up and I said to myself &quot;Geez, those frosh RA's sure have the pick of the
crop&quot;.  And I figured, hey, I could get in on that action....
<b><i><em>BZZZZTTT!!!!!!</em></i></b>  <b><i><em>BZZZZTTT!!!!!!
BZZZZTTT!!!!!!</em></i></b><p>
<p>
	<i>Bob is now going into convulsions, smoke starts to pour out of various
bodily orifices, etc.  Our own little Motley Crüe has wandered onto stage
from the Stage Whatever entrance.  By the way, Chris, we just wanted to remind
you that there are no little romances developing amongst the very very busy
workers, who by the way are still working very busily.  </i><p>
<b><p>
Chryssi:  </b>What are they doing?<p>
<b><p>
Bianca:</b><i>(sarcastically)</i>  A picnic, Chryssi.  They're having a picnic.
<i><p>
</i><b><p>
Puston:</b> <i> </i>All right, thank you very much, Bob.  Call next Tuesday to
see if you have any second-round interviews. <i> [Bob staggers off, Puston
turns to our leads.  Bianca sits up on the table and begins hooking herself up
to the electrodes and turning the switch slowly up.  As the characters speak,
they must jump on each others lines otherwise this will be way too slow)
</i>Ah, you must be the reporters from Newsweek On Campus!  <p>
<b><p>
Ingrid: </b>No we're not, we're here for housing.<i><p>
</i><b><p>
Puston:</b>  Yes of course, your magazine is very informative.  Now, I want to
show you something, the culmination of my life's work.  It should make a fine
little feature story! <i>Puston takes them over to the covered cube (or else
it's rolled over).  She motions to two busy drones to get in the goddamn light
already.  </i>This invention of mine should solve the problem Res Ed has every
holiday season with non-secular dorm decorations.   The vast diversity of our
student body makes it virtually impossible to please absolutely everyone.  Year
after year we have struggled to find some way of bringing the warmth of the
holiday season to the entire Stanford community.  We believe that we have
finally found the solution.   Biff, Mary!  <i>The drones rip off the covering,
revealing a 6'x6'x6' translucent cube) </i> <u>This</u> is the official
prototype for the Residential Education non-offensive, non-sectarian,
non-religious, non-sequitur, non-fat <b>HOLIDAY FUN UNIT!!</b><i>  Whole office
stops their work and applauds...Then big silence...</i><p>
<b><p>
Ralph:</b>  So?  <i>Shocked drones stare at the infidel Ralph.<p>
</i><b><p>
Puston:</b>  So??!!  Why... this is the wave of the future!  The slate of the
times!  Picture, if you would, a kinder, gentler holiday spirit in our
dormitories.  Franz, Helga!  Activate the Unit!  <i>Two more drones, Franz and
Helga run up to activate the Holiday Fun Unit.  The cube glows, flashes, emits
happy laser beams, and begins to emit joyous, if tuneless, beeps and boops to
celebrate mankind.  Biff, Franz, Helga, and Mary join hands, sigh, and wipe a
tear from their eyes.  They begin to skip around the cube, singing &quot;la la la la
la la, la la la la la.&quot; (perhaps to the tune of &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, or else &quot;Sweet
Child O' Mine&quot;), motioning for the leads to join them.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid:</b>  You've <u>got</u> to be kidding.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi:</b>  C'mon, you guys.  Look at how much it means to them...<p>
<b><p>
Ralph:</b>  Heck, <u>I</u> like to dance.  <i>He grabs their hands and they
start to circle around the cube and sing, at first half-heartedly, but soon
enough they really get into the joyousness and wildly gallop about, singing
loudly, etc.  Walter dances in his own unique way, in his own unique space in a
reggae-esque style like he's at a Dead concert.  It has to end eventually...<p>
</i><b><p>
Puston:</b>  Right!  That's enough!  <i>Biff, Franz, Helga, and Mary
immediately cease romp &amp; frolicking, push the others aside, deactivate the
unit, cover it, and go back to work. <p>
</i><b><p>
Walter:</b>  That... was really spiritual.   It was beautiful.<i><p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid </b><i>(fixing her hair): </i> That wasn't half bad.  You know, with a
little advertising, better packaging, a nice fat seasonal mark-up, we could
make a killing with these things.<p>
<i><p>
Bianca walks over to our enlightened foursome.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph:</b>  Hey Bianca!  You missed out on a really good thing over here.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b> <i>(sarcastic):</i>  A good thing?  A good thing, Ralph?  Was it a
good thing or were you horribly tricked into misleading yourself?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi:</b>  Actually, it was pretty fun, Bibi.<b><p>
<p>
Bianca:</b>  <i>(gets in Chryssi's face)  </i>Don't <u>EVER</u> call me Bibi!
My name is Bianca.  Well did you bundles of fun find anything out about our
housing?<p>
<b><p>
Walter:</b>  Housing?  Oh yeah, housing.  What about the Dead?<i></i><p>
<i><p>
(Chryssi begins to address Puston, but Ralph cuts her off)</i><b><p>
<p>
Ralph:</b>  Let me handle this, Chryssi.<i>(Begins to speak with a confidence
which fades quickly to cowering fear as Puston stares him down)  </i>We're here
to find out about housing!<p>
<b><p>
Puston</b> What?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b> A place to live.  We don't have a place to live.<p>
<b><p>
Walter:  </b>Or Dead Tickets.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph:</b> But we heard there are some missing students.<b><p>
<p>
Puston: </b><i>(Louder)   </i>Missing?<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: <i>(morbidly cheerful)  </i>Or dead!  <i>(Walter perks up!)</i><p>
<b><p>
Ralph: </b>Well, anyway, they're uh not around and... <b><p>
<p>
Ingrid:</b>  <i>(Pushing her way to the front)  </i>And that sounded like
walk-on spots to us.  So where do we pick up our keys?<b><p>
<p>
Puston:</b>  Right!  Well... as I was saying... <i>drones drag two naughty
students onto stage, who are kicking and screaming all the way The Puston turns
to the drones.</i>   Is there something I might help you with?<p>
<b><p>
DRONE GUARD 1:</b>  We were leading a meaningful discussion on how CIV has
transformed Stanford into a bastion of cultural awareness when we caught these
two posting....flyers!!!! <i>Hands stack of flyers to Puston.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph:</b>  What do they say?<p>
<b><p>
Puston</b><i> (reading ominously):  </i>Party.  Ten o' clock.<i><p>
</i><b><p>
ALL DRONES:</b>  GASP!<p>
<b><p>
RANDOM DRONE 1:</b>  Uh oh, here comes ASSOCIATE DEAN OF STUDENT AFFAIRS...
<u>Michael Jackson</u>!!!  <i>Underscoring starts here, it's the song &quot;Bad&quot; by
Michael Jackson (the other one, dammit)  The basic intent of the song is
&quot;You're Bad&quot;  -- MJ accuses the troublemakers of all sorts of terrible stuff.<p>
</i><b><p>
RD 2 </b><i>(to the two troublemakers)<b>:</b></i>  Oooooohhhhh... you're in
trouble!!<p>
<i><p>
Drone crowd parts to reveal ADOSA Michael Jackson impersonator, as RERS (Real
effeminate rock star) Michael Jackson, with silly jacket, bad hair, etc.  He
launches into the parody song here, with the drones and the unlikables joining
in on a M.J. video style dance .  During the dance break the Psychoclicker
conspicuously emerges a few times and steals at least a few of the chorus. This
can be really funny -- use big sacks, nooses, axes, chainsaws, lassoes, etc.
etc. etc.<p>
<p>
[THE SONG GOES HERE, ending with &quot;You're out of housing!&quot;]<p>
<p>
DGs take the naughty students away.  MJ spins offstage, presumably for another
hit of estrogen.  Drones, on some cue, resume their insanely busy working.<p>
</i><b><p>
Puston:</b>  Right then.  Where were we?  Ah, yes, right over here in our
robotics division we have the Res Ed  &quot;You Better Make a Difference&quot; public
service enforcer<i>(The Puston begins to walk toward stage whatever where the
enforcer presumably is)<p>
</i><b><p>
Walter:  </b><i>(Approaching the wing that hides our non-existing robo thing
and staring off-stage in wonder)  </i> Wow. . . an enforcer dude.<b><p>
<p>
RoboVoice from offstage: </b>You must come to the House Meeting.  You have 20
seconds to comply.<b><p>
<p>
Ingrid:</b>  LOOK!  We don't care.  We don't want to see your robot.   We don't
<u>want</u> to make a difference.  We just want to find housing, OK?<p>
<b><p>
Puston:</b>   Housing!  Why didn't you say so!  Why, that's downstairs in the
housing office! <i><p>
<p>
Bianca goes up to the Puston and grabs her by the brooch and takes her over to
the machine.<p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca: </b>10,000 volts says you can help us right here.<i></i><b><p>
<p>
Puston: </b><i>(shaken up)  </i>Actually, perhaps I can try to help you right
here.<b><p>
<p>
Bianca: </b>Good.<b><p>
<p>
Chryssi:</b>  See, we heard that there were several students reported missing,
and since we have no housing, we thought it would be fun to walk-on to their
spots!<p>
<b><p>
Puston:</b>  Ah!  Most unusual!  This is a special case; before these
particular spots can be made available for walk-ons, the presumed missing
students simply need to file a &quot;Missing Student Form&quot;, indicating that they are
indeed missing, that will remain missing for the entire academic year, and that
they will not be requesting a refund of their $50 housing deposit.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph:</b>  That sounds like a lot of paperwork.  Isn't there any other way?<p>
<b><p>
Puston:</b>  Well, if they were to be found dead, they wouldn't need to fill
out the form and we could open up the spots immediately.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid:</b>  Now there's an idea!<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi:</b>  Ingrid!<p>
<b><p>
Puston:</b>  Well, there you have it.  Glad to have been of assistance.  Now if
you'll excuse me... Franz! Helga!<p>

(OK, maybe they're from HECK.  It's pretty hard to say for sure)<p>
Scene: In front of the red.  The curtain has just come down behind them. Walter
has a daily.  There's something in the Daily -- something big.  We'll tell you
later.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b>: So here we are.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: With a bunch of missing student forms...<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: ...and no dead students.  Bummer.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: This is getting ridiculous.  We need to organize this operation.
We'll form a search committee.  I, of course, will be the chair.  In time, you
will all submit proposals for how best to begin the search, and I will choose
accordingly.  So, as for the first meeting... <i>(Ingrid whips out her big
schedule thing.)  </i>how about next Thursday?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Why don't we just look at the Daily and split up the names.
There are only four.  We should be able to find them pretty easily.  Walter,
could I see that paper for a sec?<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b> <i>(looks at paper, then back  at up them, wondering what they might
want with the paper he's been playing with):</i>  Sure, if you want it.
Anyways, I'm done with it...<p>
<i><p>
Chryssi picks up the paper, and it has in fact been turned into an incredibly
ornate cut-out peace sign (</i><cite>really</cite><i>&nbsp;ornate... lots of
frills and stuff he couldn't have done in the last 2 minutes.... so this is
obviously the work of a Ram's Head techie who slaved for hours for this one
visual joke.<p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Nice work, Walter.  Learn that in Comm 1?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  Damn.  OK, our <u>Daily</u> is now -- uh -- art.  Maybe
<u>Release</u> has some valuable information. <i>(all characters look at stack
of Releases, then at each other).<p>
</i><b><p>
All</b>: Naaah.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b> <i>(rotating and contorting the peace symbol in an attempt to
read):</i>  Wait, don't give up yet.  I think I can still read a few of the
names.  Let's see... some guy named Oliver Oxenfree who's a CS major... and...
Stan Drofnats who lives on the row.  OK, Walter, you can have this back, but
don't forget the address, okay?  <i>(returns paper to him)</i><p>

the stage from alternating left and right sides, as one group exits, the next
appears.<p>

I'm Bunny, your enthusiastic tour guide!<p>

really a <u>junior</u> university?<p>
<b><p>
OETG</b> <i>(flustered.  Beauty never takes well to scrutiny)</i>  Uh, um, well
gosh, if it's in the name, it must be, huh?  I guess we just take four years

credit!  Now, come let me show you where we buy our fro yo!<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>:  Check it out, a tour.  The Dead tour.  Maybe they're touring with
the Dead.  I'm following this.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Wait, Walter!  <i>(turns to other three)</i>  Look for Oxenfree,
I'll go with Walter and try to find Drofnats.  <p>

name's Peter Prescott Norman and I'm your tour guide today. I'm only taking
this job because the Stanford Review doesn't pay me for my fine journalism and
efforts to rid the farm of the godless Communiss' menace.  Up ahead on the left
is the English department, followed further ahead on the left by Old Union.
Also on the left is the president's office, along with the ASSU.  Quite to the
left is the Political Science department.  Way, way off to the left is the
Modern Thought and Literature offices.  And way out in left field is the
Stanford Daily.  Oh, for Christ's sake, <b>everything at this goddamn
university is off to the goddamn left!!</b>  Except for them good ol' boys at
Hoover, which is just ahead... to your <u>right</u>.  <i>( by this point,

Ralph</b>: Look out!  Here comes another tour!<p>
<b><p>
ETG</b> <i>(existential tour guide):</i>  Now, up ahead, you can see Tresidder
Memorial Union, on my right.  Which is your left.  But then again, how do I
know that my right is your left?  When you think about it, I'm only imposing my
experience on what I perceive to be your point-of-view.  And really, how can I
be sure that any of you actually exist?  And if you do, how can I know that the
way that I see the color blue is the way you see the color blue...<p>

(one of the Tour Victims shoots him with an elephant gun.  This tour victim is
actually the Jungleland tour guide, who now takes control of the tour, à

JTG</b> <i>(did you remember to put a pith helment on this guy? Thank you):</i>
Well, you never know what'll happen here on Stanford University
&quot;AdventureTours&quot;.  I'm Jim, and I'll be taking over from here.  Up ahead,
you'll notice the infamous Mayfield Avenue, otherwise known as... <b>the
row.</b>  There are a lot of fraternities along this trail, but not to worry,
they're perfectly safe as long as you don't see any of them up on the roof.<p>
<b><p>
Tour Victim 5:  </b>Aieee!!  What's that?  It's something up on the roof!<p>
<b><p>
JTG:</b>  Uh oh <i>(draws)</i>  it's one of those wild but pesky fraternity
creatures.  <i>Shoots.  Body (no, not a mannequin, a real actor) drops from
above, attired in SAE sweatshirt.  Splat.</i>  It's an SAE -- and his fly was
open.  <i>(little jungle tour guide helpers in khaki run out on stage and drag
the SAE off as the tour group leaves).</i><p>

tis our prize possession, the very very big and tall Hoover Tower!  Arrrrrr
Arrrrr!  <i>(all look up at Tower, including the tiny Pirate, who lifts his
eyepatch to see better.  Suddenly -- PsychoClicker emerges with a very big and
thus very funny hammer.  He weaves his way to the front of the tour, bops the
very small and light Pirate on the head, puts him over his shoulder and starts
to leave.  If Ram's Head is too cheap to build/buy a midget, then perhaps you
can just have the PC drag him by the foot or hair).</i><p>
<b><p>
The Whole Tour Group:</b> Hey!  Where are you going?  What about our tour?<p>
<b><p>
PC</b> <i>(Has no idea what he's gotten into):</i>  What?  Uh ohhhhh.
<i>(dragging Pirate along with him, he takes control) </i> As I was saying --
welcome one and all, to Stanford.  Yeah, this is, uh, sure is Stanford, isn't
it?  <i>(begins to speak quickly, trying to get this over with and appear
capable)</i>  And there's a building over there.  And there are some people in
it... and they're doing things that people do here.  In buildings.  Look!
Another building!  Maybe it's a library, or perhaps classrooms.  We have lots
of buildings like that.<p>

Tour Victim 3:</b>  Excuse me, what's that large statue of the man sitting down
with his head on his hand?<p>
<b><p>
PC:</b>  Uh, it's, it's... oh wait I know this, I know this.  It starts with a
T.  Uh, The Talker.  The Toucher.  Wait, maybe it's not a T.  The stressed-out
guy.  The Pusher.  The Butcher, the baker... the candlestick maker.  No, wait,
Candlestick... the arena in Oakland.  It's Manute Bol, running back for the
Oakland A's.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi: </b> Excuse me, Mr. Tour Guide, would you happen to know a guy named
Oliver Oxenfree?<p>
<b><p>
PC:</b>  <i>(panicked aside)  </i>Oliver Oxenfree!  <i>(regains composure and a
Tommy Flannagan impersonation, to boot!) </i>  Yeah...sure I do!  He hangs out
at...<u>LOTS</u> all the time. With my girlfriend.  Gretchen Carlsen -- whom
I've seen <u>naked</u>!<p>
<b><p>
The Whole Tour: </b><i>(all lean forward, amazingly interested)  </i>REALLY?<p>
<b><p>
PC: </b><i>(still impersonating Flannagan)  </i>Sure!  <p>
<b><p>
Chryssi: </b> Hey thanks!  C'mon, let's head over to LOTS.  <i>(Chryssi, Ralph,

<a name="lots">LOTS III</a></u></b><i><p>
The drop to rises revealing the interior of LOTS-III  There is a
helper/consultant cubicle upstage, dead center, with one well-dressed
consultant typing away.   On the left and right sides of the cubicle are long
rows of tables that have been cubicled off into computer stations, completely
with geeky little hackers.  In other words, no one in the audience should
mistake this for the Coffee House.  On the other hand, a large LOTS-III banner
may be useful.</i><p>
<i><p>
(Ralph, Chryssi, and Bianca enter.  They fan out in search of Oliver Oxenfree,
pulling geeks out of their cubicles and comparing them to the picture in the
Daily.  It might be funny to have all the geeks look more or less alike.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Ralph: </b>Oh, gross, it's &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; in here.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca:</b>  I don't know, I think it has a certain desperate ambience.<p>
<i><p>
(Ralph and Chryssi give Bianca a weird look, then continue searching.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Ralph: </b> Look, let's leave -- Oxenfree's not here, and this place is giving
me the creeps.<b><p>
<p>
Chryssi:</b> Don't be such a cheesehead, Ralph! <i>(suddenly) </i> Hey! I just
had a great idea!<b><p>
<p>
Bianca:</b> <i>(Momentarily enthused, and taking a  large voodoo doll out of
her pocket)  </i>Does it involve voodoo rituals?  <i>(She stabs the doll, and a
random geek jumps out of his seat with a yelp.)  </i><b><p>
<p>
Chryssi:</b> No.<b><p>
<p>
Bianca: </b><i>(totally bummed)</i>  Rats...<i>(puts the doll back in her
pocket.)</i><b><p>
<p>
Chryssi: </b> Remember that Oliver Oxenfree was-<b><p>
<p>
Ralph: </b> Don't you mean &quot;is&quot;?  We don't know for sure he's dead...<b><p>
  <p>
Bianca:</b>  <i>(sarcastically)   </i>Think positive, Ralph.  You <u>do</u>
want housing, don't you?<b><p>
<p>
Chryssi:</b>  Sssssh! As I was saying, Oxenfree's a Computer Science major,
which means...<b><p>
<p>
Ralph:</b>  He's celibate...<b><p>
<p>
Bianca:</b>  And he's never read anything deeper than Batman...<b><p>
<p>
Chryssi: </b> <u>And</u> he's got a computer account!<p>
<b><p>
Ralph: </b> So what?<b><p>
<p>
Chryssi:</b> <i>(doing impersonation)</i> &quot;So what?&quot; So, you sillies, Computer
Science majors never leave their accounts for more than three hours at a time!
If we can hack onto his account-<b><p>
<p>
Bianca:</b> <i>(not really excited, but willing to finish the sentence to keep
the ball rolling)</i> -we can find out approximately when he disappeared, and
maybe what he was doing.  Whoo-pee.   So, how are we going to do this,
anyway?<b><p>
<p>
Chryssi:</b> Well, I-<b><p>
<p>
Ralph:</b>  Stand back, this is a job for a CS105 student!  <i>(Ralph sits down
at a terminal, and starts typing at slightly-faster-than-a-turtle's pace.)  <p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca:</b>  Oh <u>yes</u>, this should be  entertaining --<b><p>
<p>
Ralph:  </b>Ah ha...And...Oh No! <i>(frustrated and upset)  </i> Shit Shit
Shit!!<b><p>
<p>
Chryssi:</b>  You can't get into the Computer Science Database?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph: </b><i>(still really frustrated)  </i>No!  I can't get this stupid Robot
to pick up the damn beeper!<p>
<i><p>
(Chryssi shakes her head and Bianca looks up, totally frustrated with the whole
thing.  Chryssi takes Ralph's place at the console and</i> <i>lights turn from
our heroes to a geek trudging a huge program to the helpers'/consultants'

Geek: </b> Could you help me with my program?<b><p>

starts, and the Robert Palmer Sexually Uniform Dancers emerge from helpers'
cubicle.  It turns out the helper is Robert Palmer, doing a Gaieties cameo
because he loves us so much.  He also sings this song.  Somewhere past the
first verse the PC pops out and drags off a Robert Palmer Girl, maybe by her
huge gold loop earring).<p>

off-center.  Oh fuck it.  Watch the show.  They're playing nerf basketball.

scurrying around busily.  The Head Hasher is ordering them around.  Busy music
is building in background, sort of like that music in 50's grade school movies
about the liver.  There is a chicken squawking in the background.)</i><b><p>
<p>
Head Hasher:</b> <i>(as a very loud cross between Julia Child and the drill
sergeant in &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot;, perhaps. )</i>  All right!  Let's see some movement
here!  Jenkins, puree the cabbage!  Sikowsky,  mash the spuds!  Baines, kill
that chicken!  <i>(a cat screech pierces the ear, er, air, and we are blessed
with the Return of the Scared Kid.)</i><b><p>
<p>
Scared (Sacred!) Kid:</b>  Boss?<b><p>
<p>
Head Hasher:</b>  Yessss?<b><p>
<p>
Scared Kid:</b>  It's faculty advisor night, remember?  <i>(everybody stops
what they're doing, and looks to the Head Hasher for guidance.)</i><b><p>
<p>
Head Hasher:</b> Oooooooh....poop.  All right darlings, it looks like we're
gonna have to do this by the book...Goldfarb, get the candelabra!  Springsteen,
wash the tablecloths!  DuBois, prepare the vichyssoise!  And Gonzales, get the
machine that goes <i>(cheezy little card puncher machine sound that isn't
really a &quot;ping&quot;, but is more of a &quot;bink&quot;.).<p>
(all the hasher types take off their stupid little FloMo food service beanies,
and put on chef's hats.  Head Hasher says something that leads into big
wonderful song which has the general theme of &quot;We Are Your Food Service, Doing
A Job For You.&quot;    The song begins with the line&quot;God, I'm a hasher, a hasher
hashes,&quot; --Debbie insists-- but it stops there, <b>right Debbie</b>?  At the
bridge of the song Walter and Ingrid should walk in and sing something
plaintive about their quest for Stan Drofnats and Dead tickets. The last verse
should feature FloMites singing about how much better this food is than the
glop they get served most nights, and express the opinion that maybe they
should have advisor dinners more often.  During this last verse, Ingrid and
Walter should be working the room, comparing people's faces to the picture in
the Daily.  I shouldn't even have to mention that the whole number will feature
lots of people dancing around with food trays, so I won't. )</i><p>
<i><p>
(The song ends with all the FloMites holding their food trays triumphantly over
their heads.  Surprisingly, the food doesn't fall off, because it's glued on.
When the music ends, the FloMites drop into their seats, and start talking.
Focus goes back to Walter and Ingrid, who have met back at center
stage.)</i><b><p>
<p>
Walter: </b>I'm sooo bummed.<b><p>
<p>
Ingrid:</b>  You couldn't find Drofnats either?<b><p>
<p>
Walter:</b>  No, it's not that.  No one's even <u>heard</u> of the Dead here.
They're all into some group called &quot;SLE.&quot;<b><p>
<p>
Ingrid: </b> <i>(peeved)</i>  Well, this is getting us nowhere.  The others
will be waiting for us at the<i>(she shudders)</i>, Coffee House.  I swear,
we're never going to figure this mess out.  <i>(PC emerges from giant soup

Scene: Front of Red.  Supposedly this is Green Library.  That means that a big
red curtain in the background will not reinforce this point. So, maybe we need
a different background.  If possible, turnstyles and desks for the clickers to
sit at and admit people.  Two lines of people -- one going in, one going out.
People going in all have their ID's ready, except for the last person in line,
who is frantically searching all over his body and elsewhere for it.  People
going out all have backpacks that get checked.  There are a few LSJUMB members
in line to get in.  They're in uniform and have their instruments.  Two big
studly library police, sunglasses on, stand next to the exit with their arms
crossed.  They're just waiting for someone to try and steal a book...they live
for it.</i><p>

of old 40's B&amp;W movies (people in grey and white, lights sort of
sepia-tone) Psychoclicker, steps into the scene, narrating.  The scene is, of
course, the Bookstore.  You were expecting something else?  There should be
cash registers, counters, and nothing that looks like big grey pyramids.</i><p>
<b><p>
Psychoclicker</b>: I used to be an ordinary student -- if you call pre-med

Song: Gimme Some Soul</b><i><p>
Part I: Chet sings about having book, PC wants the book, Chet wants PC's soul,
PC isn't going to need it anyway because he's going to be a doctor, and we all
know doctors have no souls, they have them removed in med school.  <p>
Part II: Anguish.  Psychoclicker is tormented by his need for the textbook and
the prospect of selling his soul to the bookstore.   <p>

with big ol' rebate envelopes.</i><p>

Chet: </b>So you see, my Cardinal clad foothill farmboy, there's nothing to
worry about: your soul is perfectly safe and entirely redeemable through the
generous bookstore rebate plan!  Simply fill our special giant-size rebate
envelope with 100 friends, and you get the purchase price back -- your
soul!<b><p>
<p>
Psychoclicker:</b> But...but that means I've gotta ask 100 people to give up
their souls!<p>
<b><p>
Chet:</b> No one said you had to ask them, but that's <u>your</u> problem
now!<p>

Student: </b> <i>(To the audience)</i>  Oh my God, I'm going to be turned over

anyway, how am I going to get an envelope that big through the slot in the
box?<p>
<b><p>
Chet: </b> No need to worry about that, old bean.  This is a <u>special</u>
case --  I'll come and pick up the envelope myself, wherever it's most
convenient for you.  As for deadlines, let's not trouble ourselves with those.
I'll- I mean <u>the</u> <u>Bookstore</u> - will give you an extension.  Let's

curtain closes and PC returns to the captured student)  </i>So that's the
story.  Big Game is only a few days away and I've almost reached my goal.  And
it's all been so easy.  As long as I don't click you into the library <i>(he

Strangely, everyone except our heroes are dressed in black, just like Bianca.

Walter and Ingrid are alone on stage.  Walter is engrossed in the book.  Ingrid
takes a deep, important breath and begins to undress, I mean, address him with
her eyes.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Walter, I think it's time we talk about us. <i><p>

Walter</b> <i>(Puts down book and looks up peacefully):  </i>Yeah. Us. All of

Ingrid</b>: <i>with intensity </i>  No, Walter. Us. You and Me.<i> </i>I've
been watching you closely, Walter, and what's more I know you've been watching
me closely. <p>
<p>
 <i>Whether Walter has been watching Ingrid closely up to this point is
debateable, however he is watching her now, although maybe not closely, maybe
more sympathetically, or nonchalantly or paradoxically.  <p>
</i><p>
The point is, Walter, that interest rates are rising on both our balance
sheets, if you know what I mean. <i> </i>Our portfolios may not seem
compatible, but its the high risks that bring the big payoffs!  Let's
consolidate; the time is perfect.  Our resources are plentiful, our assets are
liquid,  our capital stocks are looking good and  depreciation hasn't even
begun to set in.  I feel a merger on the horizon. Walter, I want to be your CEO
of love!  <p>

At this point Ingrid hurls her Shearson and Lehman bod at Walter's.  Fantasy
Island music begins. Walter responds somewhat in kind.  Gradually,  as Walter
and Ingrid are mashing center stage, hypnotized, zombie, weird students  file
in  from the funky stacks that are upstage and begin to form a pentagon or some
other geometric shape around  the  face-sucking couple.  Underscoring to
reprise of &quot;Weird Shit Happenin' Here&quot; begins.<p>

realizes they are surrounded by zombie students..)...</i>This is really
weird.<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>: That was really weird.  This is really cool.<i> <p>
<p>
(Zombies sing the beginning of the reprise to &quot;Weird Shit Happenin'...)<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Who are they? They look like...<i>(frightened)  </i>Zombies or...<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>: Zombies in Gaities?<p>
<b><p>
All Zombies</b>: Gaieties...We loved Gaieties...Much better than &quot; Chorus
Line&quot;...We're going to see it again and again...        <i><p>
</i><b><p>
Walter</b>: This reminds me of when Zimbardo hypnotized my psych class and made
us act like chickens,<p>
<i><p>
At this point, our zombies begin clucking and pecking the stage in their best
chicken impersonations. Note to LaPuma - this will make for great audition
material, no?<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b>: <i>semi-horrified. At least mildly disturbed. </i> Make them stop,
Walter!<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>: <i>to the zombies </i> Stop.<p>
<i><p>
All chicken impersonations come to a complete halt. The zombies are vewy, vewy
qwuiet...Ingrid looks at Walter in amazement and admiration. What a guy.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Think of all the power that the person who controls all these
people must have...<i>( Music comes down). </i>Look, Walter, it's Stan Drofnats
- the missing student from FiveFiftySomething!<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>: Whoa...and there's Oliver Oxenfree. Hey, Ollie, Ollie, Oxenfree!
(<i>All zombies scatter about the stage. This may be a lame joke, but we can
figure that out later.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Now we know where all the missing students are.  I wonder what
maniacal force could have drawn them here...<i><p>
<p>
Chet and PC come out on stage, perhaps with a burst of some&quot;These are the Bad
Guys&quot; music for the more clueless or inebriated members of our audience.<p>
</i><b><p>
Chet</b>: You will have the envelope ready for tomorrow night, won't you?  With
all one hundred students sealed inside? <p>
<b><p>
PC</b>: No problem, Chet. All I need is one more student. The situation is
under control. <p>
<b><p>
Chet</b>: Terrific.  I'll meet you here tomorrow night to pick them up and
you'll get your soul back just in time for Big Game...<p>
<b><p>
PC</b>: Nothing's going to stop me now!<p>
<i><p>
PC starts to sing his  song &quot;Soul Salvation&quot; about how he's only got one more
to go...redemption is around the corner, etc.. Because this sounds so
spiritual, let's make it a Gospel song!!! We can have the zombies echo PC's
lines as only a super-duper-Aretha esque choir can do...This is also the place
for our extremely talented choreographer to incorporate some lovely
synchronized dance movements by the zombies. It might be nice (yes Jon, nice)
to have the zombies start out kind of stiff and end up loose and  swingin'.
Amen! Note: there is to be no, I repeat, NO appearance by James Brown during
this song, thank you very much...Heh!</i><p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>: Dude, this guy is<i>un</i>cool.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: You'll never get away with this.<p>
<b><p>
PC</b>: Sure I will, and you can't stop me because... <i>Big Dramatic Pause and
then PC REALLLY LOUD </i> : GREEN LIBRARY IS NOW CLOSED!!! <i>(weird echo
effect)</i><p>
<i><p>
Blackness, utter blackness (and silence)<p>
<p>
Lights go up. Ingrid is alone on stage.  Ingrid wails a shill wail such as
female wolves who have lost their lifetime mate to the cruel hunter often wail.
Chryssi, Ralph, and  Bianca respond by rushing back onstage, rubbing their
eyes.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b>: <i>(who else would have this line?)  </i>Wow, what was that?!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: It sounded awful!<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: <i>noticing that Ingrid has stopped wailing and is standing
silently building up immense internal anger  </i>What happened Ingrid? Are you
alright?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: <i>starting low and intense and getting louder  </i>HE&quot;S GOT
WALTER!!!  <i>she begins to run in a mad frenzy upstage into Green.  Chryssi
quickly puts a quick sleeping hold on her and she falls into a docile lump.  <p>
</i><b><p>
Chryssi</b>: That will keep her quiet for a while, but we better get her out of
here.  If someone snatched Walter, they could be back for us next.  I saw a
side exit back where we were sleeping...Let's go!  <p>
<i><p>
They follow Chryssi back offstage and the red goes down and we try to print
this and get to the meeting.  </i><p>
<b><u><p>
<a name="what">What Now?</a></u></b><i><p>
Scene:  The big fluorescent curtain has just descended and our main characters
(minus Walter) emerge in front of it (having just fled from PC and Chet)..
Chryssi, Ralph, and Bianca deposit Ingrid on the stage (she's limp).  <p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b> <i>(really flustered) </i>: They've got Walter! They've got Walter!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Very good Ralph -- care to elaborate?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: They...they...they've got Walter...in there...they <u>have</u>
him!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b> <i>(unimpressed) </i>: Nice elaboration.   But <u>who</u> has him --
that's what I want to know -- and the only person who can tell us that is this
impeccably dressed but totally unconscious republican lump.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Yeah. Great Chryssi.  Use the vulcan death grip on our only witness
<i>(indicating Ingrid)  </i>--now what're we gonna do?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Relax Ralph.  She'll come out of it any second now.  We just need
something to wake her up.  Something like smelling salts...something that will
trigger a reaction in her brain...<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Here.  How about a five dollar bill?  <i>(she produces one) </i><p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Not strong enough -- we need something bigger.  Got a twenty?<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  What am I, an automatic teller machine?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b> (searching his wallet): Does she take traveller's checks?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Let's see --- <i>(she waves the checks under Ingrid's nose)  </i>
<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b> <i>(gently encouraging Ingrid to wake up) </i>:  Hey Ingrid!  The Dow
is going up!  You don't want to miss that, do you?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Good Ralph!  <i>(she encourages Ingrid, too)  </i>Oh Ingrid --
The Yen is falling -- the Yen is falling!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b><i>(bluntly) </i>: Look Ingrid, it's an SEC officer -- something
about insider trading!<p>
<b><p>
Ralph and Chryssi: </b> Bianca!!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Oops!  I was wrong!  It's the IRS -- and it's audit season!<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: We're trying to wake her up, not give her a coronary!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Speak for yourself.<p>
<i><p>
Ingrid starts to mumble and writhe a bit.  A bit.  Not a lot.<p>
</i><b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Ssh!  She's saying something!<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b> <i>(eagerly): </i> What?  What?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: It's something about Walter!  And Green Library...<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b> <i>(deadpan): </i> Great. Proper Nouns.  I'm really excited now.  <p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b><i>(aloud): </i> Walter!  Walter!  <p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  What Ingrid?  What about Walter?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Walter -- Walter -- tie dye me <u>now</u>!!  <i>(she wakes up and
stares at the other three who are now staring at her, startled by this
outburst)</i>  What are you all staring at?  Where am I and how the hell did I
get here?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  It's okay Ingrid, we're just outside Green.  You were, um,
sleeping.<b><p>
<p>
Bianca</b>: In fact, you were <u>talking</u> in your sleep.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Yeah!  You said <i>(in a high voice)  </i>&quot;Walter! Walter!  Tie
dye...&quot; <i>(Chryssi and Bianca smack their hands over Ralph's mouth).</i><p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Walter!!  They've got Walter!!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>; Oh Jesus, not this again.  <i>(Puts her hand on Ingrid's shoulder)
</i>Chryssi, how do I make her go back to sleep?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Ingrid -- tell us what happened in there!<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: What Walter and I do together in private is none of your
business!<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  We're not interested in <u>that</u> -- well, we <u>are</u>
interested in that, but first tell us who kidnapped Walter!<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Oh.  Of course.  I knew that. <i>(fixing her hair and clothing)
</i> Well, It was...well of course it was...I don't know.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: You don't know?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: I don't know.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Uh Oh.  <p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  What do you mean you don't know?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: I mean I can't remember -- Walter and I were in the library
together and then...<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: And then?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: And then I can't remember a thing.  <p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: The shock of Walter's kidnapping must have temporarily blocked her
memory -- she has amnesia!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Amnesia?  Amnesia?  You must be kidding.  That's like the Brady
Bunch -- or General Hospital -- or worse yet, Gilligan's Island...<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: I like Gilligan's Island.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: We have to figure out a way to get her memory back, or we'll never
figure out who has Walter -- and maybe the other students, too.  <p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Couldn't we just hit her on the head really hard? <i></i><p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: I'd love to sit and chat, but I don't have time.  Walter's in
trouble and I'm going to get him.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Don't be ridiculous Ingrid, we have no idea who has him or why.
It could be really dangerous.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Big deal.   I have this really large gun in the trunk of my BMW and
I'm going to get it.  I've been waiting to use this thing all year; got it
cheap 'cause it was only used for one afternoon -- you remember Grenada?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: I lived in Granada freshman year.  I don't remember getting a gun,
though...<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Shut up Ralph.  <i>(spotlight on Ingrid.  She's tossed a big gun
from offstage.  Fly in a big NRA banner, like one sees in magazines. Underscore
next line with Battle Hymn of the Republic)  ...</i>You see, I like the room
clearing firepower one of these babies puts in my strong but feminine hands.
There's nothing like the sense of security one has, knowing that one can kill
several hundred people in a matter of seconds -- and with just one round of
ammo.  I'm Ingrid -- and I'm the NRA.  <i>(she turns back to the group.  Lights
back to normal.)  </i> Now then.  You were saying?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: I was saying we can't do this alone.  The gun's nice and all
<i>(gently takes the gun from Ingrid and tosses it back offstage)</i>, but I
think you're responding a bit hastily -- This is no job for a woman and a gun.
This is a job for...DonMan and Robyn!<p>
<i><p>
(After someone says &quot;We need Donman and Robyn!&quot; , and the orchestra strikes the
&quot;Batman&quot; theme, and the Bat-signal flashes throughout MemAud, Jon and Jen walk
up to the front of the stage.  The music  peters out, and the searchlights come
down on our head writers.)<p>
</i><b><p>
Jon</b>: Hi, I'm Jon.<p>
<b><p>
Jen</b>: And I'm Jen.<p>
<b><p>
Both</b>:  And we're the head writers of Gaieties.<p>
<b><p>
Jon</b>:  We had planned for Don Kennedy and his wife, Robyn, to do a hilarious
&quot;Donman and Robyn&quot; sketch at this point...<p>
<b><p>
Jen</b>:  ...however, they're in Japan right now.<p>
<b><p>
Jon</b>:  Fortunately, they sent us slides of their vacations.<p>
<b><p>
Jen</b>:  Slides, guys.<p>
<i><p>
(Slides of the Kennedys doing stuff in Japan with funny commentary written by
us, performed by actors)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Well, they were a lot of help.  Now what?  Rambette is still
missing her memory.  Could we hit her now?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: It's not a physical ailment, Bibi...<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: BIBI???  Where's the gun Ingrid?  I'm blowing Chryssi's pretty
little face off.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Bianca!  I meant Bianca!  Uh, as I was saying.  Ingrid's block is
obviously psychological.  We need to take her somewhere where they have highly
trained personnel who can give her professional help.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: The Bridge!<p>
<i><p>
Chryssi ponders this.  It's not at all what she had in mind.  <p>
</i><b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Not exactly.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: <i>(with dopey enthusiasm) </i>We could try it, though.<p>
<i><p>
</i><b><u><p>
<a name="bridge">The Bridge</a></u></b><i><p>
Yes, the bridge.  No Spade Fondue anywhere.  Yay!  The leads have decided to
take Ingrid here for counseling to try to coax her out of her amnesia.    We do
a curtain up (or something) and end up with the main counseling desk at stage
left and an unlit support group (sitting on big, fluffy pillows) taking up much
of the rest of the stage.  As the lights come up, we hear the compassionate
Bridge counselor, Andrew, talking to someone on the phone.  The leads, of
course, don't have time for this...<p>
</i><b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Yes, yes, I understand.  That's perfectly normal.  So how did you
feel after she burned your photo... I see... yeah, I know what you mean.  Ooh,
dead roses too, huh?  Yeah, dead roses are rough.  So what did you do next?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Uh, hello, excuse me, this is the Bridge, right?  Can we get some
help for our friend here?<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Whoa... uh, can you hang on a second <i>(puts phone down for a
second)</i>  Yes, this is the Bridge, but I'm busy with this call, so can you
hold on until I'm done with this?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  Well, no.  We can't<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Look, I can't help you until this counsel<i> (points at phone)
</i> is finished.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Gimme that!  <i>(grabs phone)</i>  OK, pal, what's your problem?
<i>(pause - then with the usual sarcasm)</i>  Ooooh, nooooo.... his
girly-whirly left him all alone.  And now he's gonna cry, because she's
sleeping with another man... <i>(getting hostile now)</i>  AS WELL SHE SHOULD!
You're lucky she didn't wise up earlier!  Face it, pal:  <b>LOVE SUCKS!</b><i>
(slams down phone).</i><p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  I don't believe you just did that.  That was so insensitive.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  What?  I took the class.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  What were you?  A case study?  Oh, what are we doing here anyway?
I'm getting out of here.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Wait a minute, Ingrid.  <i>(to Andrew)</i>  Look, do you handle
amnesia cases?<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Amnesia is generally a medical problem and we don't deal with that
kind of thing at the Bridge.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  That does it; we hit her on the head.  Hand me that dictionary.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b> <i>(looking at books on desk):</i>  Will the phone book do?<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  You're next, Ralph.<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:<i>(slowly and deliberately)  </i>So who can't remember who he or
she is?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:   I know perfectly well who I am.  My name is Ingrid and I'm the
one they dragged to this ridiculous group therapy pit because I was with...
<i>sigh</i>  Walter in the stacks of Green Library and he was kidnapped away
from me and for the life of me I can't remember what happened next but if you
would just let me call my analyst back home he'd give me a clean bill of
health.<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Oh... so it would appear you are blocking out a traumatic
experience, is that right?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  OK, forget this.  Gimme back my gun.<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Gun, you have a gun?  <i>(panicked -- starts thinking aloud)</i>
OK, OK, subject has a gun... What did they teach us?  Uh, um, check for
suicidal tendencies?  <i> (to Ingrid)</i>  Have you been very depressed
recently?  Have you written a note?  Do you think you might want to hurt
yourself?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  What?  No, of course not.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b><i> (to Andrew):</i>  Actually, I think <u>you</u> were more the
target she had in mind.<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Oh dear.  OK, OK, breathe deeply, stay calm.  Unstable, angry,
well-armed... what do I do?  Bullhorn  <i>(gets a bullhorn out of the desk,
points it right at Ingrid and starts addressing her like on a police show or
something)</i>  Ingrid, we know you have a gun, come out quitely and no one
gets hurt.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  A bullhorn?  Neat!  <i>(grabs it away and starts playing with it,
starts addressing audience)</i>  Welcome to the ASSU Sunday Flicks.  Tonight's
flick is &quot;Indiana Jones and the Children's Crusade&quot;.  Oh, wait, no.  JOEL, get
off the baby sitter!!  Yeah, yeah!  <i>(muffles voice on this next one)</i>
Uh, let's see, you had an Ultimate Cheeseburger, jumbo fries and an ice tea
with a little bit of lemon?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b> <i>(takes back bullhorn):</i>  C'mon, Ralph, enough playing
around..  <i>Puts it back on desk.</i>  We're here to try to get Ingrid's
memory back.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Has a frontal lobotomy been considered yet?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  I don't think that'll be neccessary.  Andrew here has everything
under control.  Right, Andrew?<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b> <i>(still half-crazed):</i>  What?  Control?  Where's my bullhorn?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  You don't need the bullhorn, just calm down.  Let me give you a
nice.... shoulder rub.... just sit right down <i>(she should be at least
remotely sensual about this)</i>  OK, Andrew, how can we get Ingrid's memory
back?<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b> <i>(very relaxed.  Think massage and hot tub and Windham Hill
records here, kids):</i>  Ooooh, yeah.  Uh huh... Ingrid's memory.  I don't
know, you could just hit her on the head with something real hard.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  I knew it!  I told you!<p>
<b><p>
Andrew</b>:  Nah, just kidding.  You could try to jar her memory through shared
experience.  Try one of the Bridge's therapy groups, people who are just
like...<p>
<i><p>
WHAM!  Lights up on the therapy group... the leads drift over there as we find
that the 550something characters (among others) are there in counseling...<p>
</i><b><p>
Nancy</b>:  Squid!  And Elliot tried to pass it off on me by calling it
&quot;calamari&quot;.  He pays no attention to my needs!<p>
<b><p>
Keith the group counselor: </b> Now Nancy, is an hors d'oeuvre really worthy of
such hostility?<p>
<b><p>
Cameron</b>: I sympathize entirely.  I woulldn't eat anything out of 20,000
leagues under the sea.<p>
<b><p>
Elliot</b>:  Oooo.  A literary allusion.  I'm floored.  Really.<p>
<b><p>
Keith</b>: Tsk tsk tsk!  No room for hostility!  Okay -- everyone: deep
breaths!<p>
<i><p>
The whole group breathes exaggeratedly and our main characters approach the
group.  One of the group puts his hand up.  His name's Dave.<p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Look.  Darth Vaders anonymous.  <p>
<b><p>
Keith</b> <i>(without stopping his big breaths or opening his eyes):   </i>Take
a seat.  Or a cushion.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Do you have a bullhorn too?<p>
<b><p>
Keith</b>: What's the trouble here, friends?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Our friend Ingrid's having trouble with her memory. <p>
<b><p>
Keith</b> <i>(noticing Dave's raised hand) :</i> Yes Dave?<p>
<b><p>
Dave</b>: I'm feeling very threatened Keith.  Very threatened by these new
group members who haven't been properly introduced according to group rules.<p>
<b><p>
Keith:</b> Okay new people, introduce yourselves, first names only.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Chryssi.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Ralph.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Fuck you.<p>
<i><p>
Group begins their exaggerated deep breathing again.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Could we speed this up a bit?<p>
<b><p>
Hope</b>: <i>(To Ingrid)</i>  Hey! I recognize you -- you came by just this
afternoon with your strange hippie friend!<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: <i>(sighs)  </i>Walter!<p>
<b><p>
Elliot</b>: Walter?   Hey, Walter's the  guy who fed all our Evian to the ficus
tree!  Right Michael?<p>
<b><p>
Nancy</b>:  As if that mattered -- you're always just filling the Evian bottles
up with tap water and putting them back in the fridge!<p>
<i><p>
Elliot collapses his head in shame.<p>
</i><b><p>
Elliot</b>: That's right Nancy, go ahead -- expose me!<p>
<b><p>
Keith:</b> I'm sensing some real emotion here.  Let's explore these feelings
with some word association.  I'll say a word and then each of you respond with
the word that first pops into your head, alright?  I'll begin now: LOVE<p>

Michael</b>: Me<p>
<b><p>
Hope</b>: Me<p>
<b><p>
Nancy</b>: Me<p>
<b><p>
Elliot</b>: My needs<p>

Dave</b>: My mother...I hate my mother <i>(turns to Elliot)  </i>You look like
my mother<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Family<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Feud<p>
<b><p>
Cameron</b>: Love. A seething whirlpool of despair that sucks all life into it.
Two people meet.  Nothing clicks. <p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Clicks!  Click Click! <i>(Bong! Big chord)</i><p>
<b><p>
Cameron</b>: And you're left in the middle of a dark, evil, pointless life.  It
goes by too fast and leaves you with nothing but a vapor trail.  Like a jet.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Jet?  Jet -- Chet!  That guy's name was Chet!  <i>(Bong!  Next big
chord)</i><p>
<b><p>
Cameron</b>: And then suddenly you're swallowed.  Absorbed.  Enveloped.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Enveloped...enveloped...envelope!   OH MY GOD!  <i>(Bong!  Biggest
chord of all!)</i><p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: What is it Ingrid?  What's wrong?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: I've got it now! I remember!  While Walter and I were in the South
stacks I remember seeing that bizarre portal monitor...you know, the guy who
clicked us into Green?  Anyway, he was conspiring with this disgusting Berkeley
person named &quot;Chet.&quot;  <i>(Big Music!)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Chet?  <p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Chet!  And Chet's got this clicker person collecting Stanford
students and holding them in the bowels of Green -- that's where all the
missing students are.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Great.  I have the missing student form right here!<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Not so fast.  Apparently, this psychotic clicker is going to
extract the students' souls, put them in a giant size rebate envelope...<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Rebate envelope?  You mean like the Bookstore's rebate envelope?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Exactly.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: But the bookstore doesn't offer a rebate on souls.  So that
means...<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: That this Chet guy has duped Mr. Clicker into kidnapping innocent
Stanford students' souls for him and he's going to use them to...I can't say
it.   You say it Chryssi.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: Enough talk!!  They've got Walter in an envelope and I for one am
going in after him! Where'd you put my gun?<p>
<i><p>
(Begins heading offstage)<p>
</i><b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Now, Ingy, I thought we'd decided the gun was not the
answer...<i>(she pulls out a pistol)  </i>...but it's close enough for partial
credit.<p>
<i><p>
Bianca follows Ingrid offstage .  Ralph and Chryssi follow.  Goodbye. </i><p>
<b><u><p>
Finalé Flambé Scene</u></b><i><p>
<a name="finale">FINALE:</a>  Stylized assault.  They come out (f.o.r.) heavily-armed, one at a time
to some ominous background music (like the beginning of Star Wars or Superman
or something equally immense and written by John Williams) each turns sharply
and faces the audiance.  Each carries a weapon of some significance.  Ingrid,
of course, has the AK-47 she had earlier.  Bianca has a whip.  Chyrssi now has
a crossbow. And why not?  Ralph has a funnelator. </i><p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Okay.  This is it.  What are we doing?  Chryssi?<p>
	<i>During this exchange Ingrid is obviously impatient.  She really wants out
of here and into the action.</i><p>
	<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Here's the schematic: <i>(roll out a chalk board with pre-drawn
diagrams. )  </i>This <i>(she points with her weapon -- maybe one of those red
laser light things.  Yeah, right.)</i> is the entrance to the steam tunnels.
We enter here, <i>(points again) </i> follow the tunnel straight ahead for 74
meters, take the left turn and the first vent overhead leads straight into the
South Stacks.<p>

Ralph</b>:  Is that where the Psychoclicker hands over the students to Chet
&quot;The Evil Cal Guy&quot;?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>: That's where they were when...Walter and I were...Yes.  That's it.
There's no way they could have moved that envelope so quickly.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph:</b> So where exactly do we come out?<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Do you really want to know? <i>(she braces herself to tell
them)</i>...Well, you know those lockers that grad students use to keep books
in?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: You're kidding...<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Nope.  <i>(She flips the chalkboard over -- it's a big picture of
the lockers)  </i>That's it.  That's where we come out.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b> <i>(impatient as all get out)</i>: Let's go.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  Go?  What do we do when we get there?  <p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Right.  We can't go in without a plan!  We need to be
organized!<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  NO!   THIS ISN'T FILE CABINETS AND FOLDERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!
THIS IS <u>WALTER!!!!</u><p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  I don't mean to spoil anyone's fun, but has it occured to you that
Walter would advocate non-violence in this situation?<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  But that's whats so wonderful about Walter.  He doesn't know
what's good for him.<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM?  HE'S A PLANT!  What's good for him is water,
sunlight, and dirt!<p>
<p>
	<i>(They're in each other's faces.  Big tension.  Ralphy &amp; Chryssi look
back and forth like in a tennis match)<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Take that back, you whining bohemian bitch!<i><p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b> (<i>loud and excited, says Jon):</i>  <b>GIRL FIGHT!</b> <i>(The
three women appear ready to beat the heck out of him.)</i>      Hey, just
kidding.<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b> <i>(Stepping in between Ingi and Bibi, who are still staring each
other down.)</i>:  I don't mean to intrude, but if we don't do something now,
Walter and all those other innocent students will be whisked off to Berkeley
faster than you can say...<p>
<b><p>
JANET</b> <i>(in perfect time to finish Chryssi's sentence):</i>  HI!  I'm
Janet from the 21st century, and I've come here to examine life from the
perspective of the Stanford student of the 1980's!<i><p>
La Babamba music begins, but is almost immediately superceded by the familiar
opening notes to &quot;Jaws&quot;.  A shark fin appears from the pit.<p>
</i><b><p>
ROY SCHEIDER </b><i>(blowing whistle from juliet)</i> :  Everybody, OUT OF THE
ORCHESTRA PIT!!  <i>Sure enough, actors dressed in bathing suits and carrying
big inflatable pool boats, lounges, beach balls, surfboards, etc. begin running
from the pit.  The big giant mylar shark fin passes across the front of the pit
and Bianca pushes Janet in.  Mannequin limbs, fake blood and water fly out,
culminating with a blond wig.  Janet bites it  (get it?).  Our heroes run back
on to the stage and look at one another, as if bonded by this shared
experience.<p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca</b>:  I was hoping something like that would happen. <p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b> <i>(perhaps lighting a cigarette.  Perhaps not.) </i>:  Yeah.  That
was almost as much fun as when I foreclosed on little Jill Stern's lemonade
stand back in first grade...Wait!  What are we doing here?  LET'S GO SAVE
WALTER!!!<i><p>
<p>
 Goin' in thru the steam tunnels, they tie Ingrid to a big thick rope that she
was carrying it over her shoulder... she jumps through into
</i><cite>blinding</cite><i> light at the crack in bottom of curtain (a la
Poltergeist.  Ingrid goes in, rope breaks.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b>: <i>(deadpan and as if nobody noticed)  </i>The rope broke.<i></i><p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>: Perceptive Ralph, perceptive.   So much for the plan.  <p>
<i><p>
They toss the rope aside.  Chryssi jumps through the crack in the curtain.
Bianca follows.  Then Ralph.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b>: Do I need housing this badly?  <p>
<i><p>
A hand comes out and pulls him through.  Big applause.  Red rises.<p>
<p>
Scene: A bunch of them lockers that grad students use to keep their books in.
They're big enough to slide a person through, at least.  Chryssi and Bianca
kick open the locker doors from the inside and jump out onto the stage.<p>
</i><b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Where's Ralph?<p>
<i><p>
Sound: &quot;Bang bang bang!&quot; Ralph is kicking at the inside of his locker.  It's
locked. Kinda like Derek Smalls' cocoon in &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;. <p>
</i><b><p>
Ralph</b>: <i>(whining)  </i>Guys?  Guys?  Mine's locked.<i> <p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca</b>: So what are you trying to say Ralph?<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: LEMME OUT!!  <i></i><p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: Just a second Ralph -- I saw this neat trick on MacGyver: this
dustball and a little spit are kind of like plastique!  <i>(licks her finger to
test the air)  </i> Okay!  Here we go!  <i>(She puts the dustball on the lock)
</i>Stand back!  <i>(she kicks it, it opens)  </i>There.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b> <i>(getting out of locker):</i>  Chryssi, you're weird.<p>
<i><p>
Ingrid pops out of trap door.  Looks around, places AK-47 on the stage.  Climbs
out.</i><i><p>
Harmonica music is increasingly audible... which means that we're close to
finishing this off.</i><p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  I hear Walter!  It's about time!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b> <i>(sarcastic): </i> It's not about time.  It's about love.  It's
about Walter.  It's about saving Stanford and foiling Cal and making everything
come up roses.  <i>(She turns from the rest of them and sticks her finger down
her throat.)</i><p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  That's the spirit, Bibi!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  That's it Chryssi, you're wasted...<i>(points her gun at
Chryssi)</i><p>
<i><p>
Ralph puts his finger in the end of Bianca's gun barrel.  Harmonica music gets
progressively louder.</i><p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>: Hold on Bianca -- the music's getting louder!  They're coming this
way!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca: </b>Ralph, take your finger out of my barrel.  <i>(he does).</i><p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: <i> </i>OK everyone, hide.  <p>
<i><p>
Our Unlikables hide behind any part of the stage as is convenient, considering
the stage built by the techies.  Ingrid has to be dragged off, as she's in a
tad more confrontational mode then the rest.<p>
Chet and Psychoclicker lug unbelievably large Bookstore Rebate Envelope on to
stage.  There would appear to be people inside (behind, more likely) the
envelope.  They stop and come downstage for big-time important dialogue.<p>
</i><b><p>
CHET</b>:  You've done well, my friend.  It's the night before Big Game, and
you've got 100 Stanford Students in this giant rebate envelope <i>(captured
students let out a collossal moan ) </i>.  In accordance with our agreement,
and by the power invested in my by the state of California and the city of
Berkeley, I hereby return your soul.<p>
<i><p>
Silly light trickery!  Yay!  Perhaps sounds too.<p>
</i><b><p>
PSYCHOCLICKER</b>:  BERKELEY?!<p>
<i><p>
Our heroes jump out from hiding.<p>
</i><b><p>
Bianca</b> <i>(sarcastic):</i>  No, Davis.  Of course he's from Berkeley!<i><p>
Our heroes are facing Chet , all are pointing their weapons at him.<p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  Give us the envelope.<p>
<b><p>
CHET</b>:  Give you the envelope?  Why, in this envelope, I have 100 students,
and with it I'll be able to...<p>
<b><p>
PSYCHOCLICKER</b>:  DON'T SAY IT!<p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  It's the end of the goddamn show.  Tell us what you're going to
with 100 students' souls.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid</b>:  I don't care about 100 souls.  I just care about one.  I just want
my Walter!  <i>Harmony in background from Walter's harmonica (it's Jefferson
Airplane's &quot;Don't You Want Somebody To Love&quot;... if we can get the rights)<p>
<p>
With this, they all point their massive firepower right at Chet.  And cock
hammers, remove safeties, load funnelators, etc.  Big finale song begins as
students file out of envelope and everyone sings about how much they hate USC
and how USC sucks...meanwhile, Chet is running around telling them that <b>they
</b>suck.  Something like...<p>
</i><b><p>
CHET</b>:  Oh, come on.  I thought you were clever Stanford students.  Aren't
you the ones who got 1500 on your SATs?  Aren't you the ones not going to
public school?  Aren't you the ones who got in?  Surely, you can think of
something better than this petty violence.  Don't you have something
&quot;<u>clever</u>&quot; up your sleeves?<i>  (Ralph looks up his sleeve, not Chet's.)<p>
<p>
(Then music comes down for dialogue)</i><p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b>:  Well, Chet, let's put it this way.  Paper beats rock...<p>
<b><p>
Chryssi</b>: <i> </i>Rock beats scissors...<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  Um... four of a kind beats a pair?<p>
<b><p>
INGIRD</b>:  And an AK-47 beats everything.<p>
<b><p>
Ingrid, Ralph, Chryssi, Bianca: </b> Face it Chet:  no one's going to miss one
lousy weenie.<p>
<i><p>
Lights down.  Sound of gunfire, whip crack, funnelator boing, crossbow phhhhht,
and random cow moos, an awful lot of it.  Also big final chords, terrifying
sopranos, etc. Chet screams.  Lights go back up.  Chet is dying on the stage
with a crossbow arrow through his chest, a funnelated watermelon on top of his
head, a whip wrapped round his neck, and one of his legs lying on the other
side of the stage, twitching.<p>
<p>
As he dies, Chet explains his unknown plan and finishes with...<p>
</i><b><p>
CHET</b>:  All I needed was 100 Stanford students to <b>(device here)</b> and
it would've worked, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids, and that darn
Deadhead and his harmonica!  <i>(Chet dies.)<p>
<p>
 Walter is sitting in front of the envelope, playing a victorious melody<p>
</i><b><p>
PC</b> <i>(wimpy and apologetic)</i>:  Uh, jeez guys, I'm really sorry. <p>
<b><p>
Bianca</b> <i>(estatic.  No, just kidding, she's really sarcastic again.) </i>:
You should be.<p>
<b><p>
Ralph</b>:  Yeah!  <i>(witty to the end.)<p>
</i><b><p>
Chryssi</b>:  Waitasecond guys, we can't blame this poor, pathetic wretch for
his actions!  He was but a pawn who fell into the demonic clutches of the
Weenies!<p>
<b><p>
PC</b> <i>(getting down on his knees, and hugging Chryssi's)</i> :  Oh, thank
you thank you thank you thank you thank you <i>(this goes on and on as we do
one more tricky shift over to Walter and Ingrid, who have been celbrating their
reuniting during the last few lines.)</i> <i><p>
</i><b><p>
Ingrid</b> <i>(Coming up for air) </i>:  Walter!  I'm so glad you're OK!<p>
<b><p>
Walter</b>:  I'm OK, you're OK.  We're all OK.  Well, except for him <i>(points
to Chet)  </i>I got Dead tickets <i>(holds them up).</i>  I got you guys
housing.  I met some friends in the envelope; they said you could stay with
them.  C'mon out, guys...<p>
<i><p>
LSJUMB bursts through rebate envelope.  Yay!  What big fun, assuming the
techies are sufficiently non-lame as to bother with making envelopes for each
show.  But , of course, they won't.  Even though it's only 3 lousy pieces of
paper, they wouldn't do that for us.<p>

<a name="version-info">Notes about version 1.5</a><p>
This is a <u>very</u> early version of Gaieties '89, possibly only the second or third edition to have all the scenes in place.<p>

Head Writers Jon Sherman and Jen Collins made some major changes in
the structure of the script after this version, most notably moving
&quot;The Scene Before the Flashback Scene&quot; and &quot;Flashback!&quot; much earlier,
to get the Psychoclicker's story going sooner.<p>

One scene from this version, &quot;What Now?&quot; was cut in its entirety.
They felt it would be stupid and boring to have a five to ten minute
scene of characters standing around talking about what had just
happened.  A quick segue from &quot;Big Spooky Green Scene&quot; into &quot;The
Bridge&quot; worked just as well.<p>

A few new scenes were written over the summer.  &quot;Weird Shit Happenin'
Here&quot; was expanded into a large &quot;Donahue&quot; parody.  The leads were
dropped from &quot;Tour Guides&quot; (a final version of that scene has been
found -- see below).  Dean Jean did a cameo in &quot;Admission
Impossible&quot;, a spy parody about investigating how a weenie infiltrated
the frosh admissions process.  The &quot;Finale&quot; was completely rewritten
-- just shooting Chet seemed pretty anti-climactic and not so clever
-- and incorporated an audio cameo by Don &amp; Robyn Kennedy, who
the leads run into while crawling through the steam tunnels to make
their assault on Green Library.<p>

Finally, Jon added lots of references to the 1990 earthquake.
Ingrid's need for housing was no longer her distaste for Synergy, but
the fact that Synergy got wiped out by the quake (she has a great line
about &quot;if you need help cramming the rest of the house into the
recycling barrels, give me a call&quot;).  I hope Jon will some day be able
to raise his Jasmine hard-drive from the dead so we can make the final
version available by WWW.<p>

A scene listing for the final show is listed below, with links to early versions of the scenes when appropriate.<p>
