<h2>Act I</h2>
<b>Stanford, You're a Mess!</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
<i>Picture this: In front of red.  News type desk and Ted Koppel stage right.
Nightline banner hangs ominously over Ted's head.  He has a guest, too.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Ted:<i> </i></b><i>(Or someone who looks just like him.)</i>   Good
evening. I'm Ted Koppel and this is a special quickie edition of Nightline.
Tonight--Stanford: a university run amok. A once thriving and proud institution
of higher learning torn asunder. Early this morning, incoming President Gerhard
Casper officially announced the dismantling of Stanford, explaining that in an
early-term referendum the student body voted overwhelmingly that they
&quot;preferred not to have a university.&quot; The school's once-tranquil California
campus has been divided into thirteen independent territories who will maintain
complete ownership of their properties. Fences have sprung up along territorial
boundaries, and border guards regulate movement between regions. Classes have
been cancelled while the transition from university to independent territories
is made. Our on-the-scene camerapersons have captured the horrifying images of
the breakup on tape.<p>
<p>
<i>Overture takes place while stage is filled with graphic images slide-show of
the break-up.  </i><p>
<p>
<b>Ted</b>:  With me in the studio tonight is Stanford Watchdog Paul Biddle,
here to discuss the serious implications of the breakup. <i>(Spotlight on
Biddle, fat guy with white hair and big glasses. He's got a thick cigar and
makes lots of phlegm noises)  </i> Mr. Biddle, was it the Gorbachev touch or
something more?<p>
<p>
<b>Biddle</b>: <i>(Coughs up some phlegm.)</i>   <b>I</b> could have told you
it was coming. Those pansy-faced Stanford candy-asses have been begging for
something like this to happen! Ever since they changed their mascot from the
Indian, I knew they were on their way down. <i>(He erupts in a fit of laughter
that turns into coughing. He recovers eventually.)   </i>Where's an ashtray? <p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Ted</b>: Very interesting, Mr. Biddle. Rumors abound that a group of
Japanese investors is currently considering a buyout--<p>
<p>
<b>Biddle</b>: What that pantywaist university needs is a responsible person in
charge--like me! The first thing I'd do is teach those kids some discipline!
Give `em readings that'll teach them how to survive in the real world! No more
of this <i>Popol Vuh</i>  crap! <p>
<p>
<b>Ted</b>: Yes, thank you.<p>
<p>
<b>Biddle</b>: I'd give `em the greats! William F. Buckley, Pat Buchanan, and
Joe Bob at the drive-in, just to keep them well rounded. And another thing...<p>
<i>(Koppel pulls out gong from under his desk and gongs. Goons come out to drag
Biddle off.)   </i> Damn. <i>mumble mumble.  </i>Communist plot. <i>mumble
mumble.  </i>They called me crazy back at the lab. . .<i>mumble mumble.</i><p>
<p>
<b>Ted</b>: And now, why don't we take a caller ? Our first caller is...
(<i>Checks his earphone thing)  </i> Fred from Alameda County.  Go ahead
Fred.<p>
<p>
<b>Fred:</b>  I'm a student at Cal Berkeley, and I understand how painful this
must be for your university.  I just wanted to say... <i>(In singsong voice)
</i>nyah nyah nyaah nyah nyah nyah.  Your school's broken up... Your school's
broken up... You don't got no ice cream... You don't got no ice cream.<p>
<p>
<i>Old hecklers from the Muppet show, two puppets, up in the juliet.  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Statler</b>:  I'd scream too, if I went to Cal!<p>
<p>
<b>Waldorf:</b>  Where'd they get this guy?  Cut back to Cronkite!<p>
<p>
<b>Ted:</b>  Hello, Fred?  Do you have anything else to add?<p>
<p>
<b>Fred:  </b>Yeah.  Just that it's too bad Stanford won't be able to field a
football team on November 21st.  Looks like Big Game and that Axe thing finally
belong to the mighty Golden Bears!  <p>
<p>
<b>Waldorf:</b>  What'd he say, the Golden Girls?  <i>(Guffaw.) </i>  Didn't
you have a date with Blanche last night?<p>
<p>
<b>Statler:</b>  No, but I did split a can of prunes with your mother!
<i>(Guffaw. ) </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Ted</b>: <i>(Acknowledges hecklers.)   </i>How'd those guys get that keg in
here? But we have more important questions to ask: Can Stanford reunite? Is
this process irreversible? Is this my real hair? Let's go to our on-the-spot
reporter, Stanford Daily staff writer Kathryn Swanson-Dusenberry, who will be
following the action... <i>(Dramatic pauses.)  </i>as it unfolds... over the
next few weeks... Kathryn? <p>
<p>
<i>Big &quot;A Current Affair&quot; golf club &quot;schwing&quot; sound comes out of nowhere. Ted's
desk rolls off the stage. Curtain rises to reveal Kathryn at center stage with
a microphone. She's by the wall outside the Physics Tank. People are extending
the wall.  Groups of random people (the same ones each time) run back and forth
across the stage screaming quietly, so dialogue can still be heard. As this
scene unfolds, spotlights occasionally sweep the stage, and helicopter sounds
scare the audience. A post office worker walks across the stage, very slowly so
that by the end of the scene, he's still on stage. He should have a letter in
an outstretched hand. </i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: Thank you, Ted. I'm reporting live from the Physics Tank on the
Stanford University campus, and as you can see behind me, things are chaotic.
Bicycles are on fire everywhere, and roving bands of vandals rend the fabric of
this University.  People seem to be frightened and confused.<p>
<p>
<b>STANFORD YOU'RE A MESS</b><p>

<i>Song comes to an exhilarating finish and Kathryn addresses Ted from center
stage.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Kathryn</b>: Ted, the surprise announcement that the Stanford student
body &quot;prefers not to have a university,&quot; has led to a frightening scene of
confusion, violence, and cheap sets.  Just seconds ago, I myself was a victim
of the anarchy, nearly getting run over by a confused yet inseparable group of
50 Freshmen.  Let's see if we can grab someone here to get a better sense of
what's going on.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><i>At this point, Kathryn tries to stop and question people as they run
past her. Surprisingly enough, nobody stops.</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: <i>(Flagman runs by with the Stanford flag all ripped to
shreds.)   </i>Excuse me sir, what's your perspective on--<i>(He's gone by now.
A Stanford court juggler runs by, juggling flaming torches or maybe just big
knives.</i>  Excuse me, hello, can you tell me-- <i>(S/he's gone by now. A
skateboarder skates by as a Stanford cop runs after him/her, shooting and
missing.) </i> Sir, sir, can I-- <i>(Cop runs by) </i> Officer, officer, a
word, please! <i>(Cop runs off. Roller Orientation Volunteer skates up. Kathryn
grabs her.)  </i>You, the OV, how do you feel about this madness that surrounds
us, this mayhem that is destroying our school?<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>OV</b>: <i>(On rollerblades, with red shirt.)</i>   Mayhem? What
mayhem? Everything here seems calm to me. NOT! I was going to the Co-Po to pick
up some fro-yo when, like, oh no, there were these guys from Flo-Mo, who said
they wanted to see if they had any mail in their Po-Bos, when all of a
sudden--<i>(Bullet , with appropriate sound effect, comes from nowhere and
kills OV.)</i>   O, I am slain! Yet another victim of the inane rollerblade
shooting.  You must stop the violence.  All of you.  You must stop it....<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><i>A group of people in band blazers and hats runs by with a keg. Sound
effects accompany them: train-chugging, accordions, and cat screeches.</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Ted VO</b>: Kathryn, this is Ted Koppel on the Nightline set. It appears
that you're having some difficulty getting information on the Stanford
breakup.<p>
 <p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: <i>(Nervous for her reporting future.)</i>   Why no, Ted...
<i>(She looks down at the dead rollerblade OV.) </i>  We have one confirmed
casualty as a result of the mayhem, and I have learned that...<i>(She thinks.)
</i>...lots of people are running from place to place. Obviously, without their
classes these students have no direction!  Ted, I'm going to see if I can get
right into the middle of the fray. <p>
<p>
<i>A group of people in band blazers and hats runs by with a bike rack.  Sound
effect again, especially the meow!</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b> Ted, something is obviously amiss on this campus, but I'm not
quite sure what it is. Let me see if I can get another opinion on this
situation. <i>(She grabs Tom Shane.)   </i>Excuse me, sir, do you have any
information about the breakup?<p>
<p>
<b>Tom Shane</b>: Breakup? I'm so sorry to hear you've had a breakup. If you
ever get back together with your fiancée, be sure to stop by my store.
I'm Tom Shane, and at the Shane company, we import our  diamonds directly from
Peruvian mines. You've picked a great time to buy, because right now we're
offering Belgian chocolates, <b>from Belgium</b>, with every purchase.  Stop by
our store.  It's located across from the Dunfey in San Mateo.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: <i>(Somewhat anguished</i> .) Why thank you, Tom. Ted, I know a
lot more about diamonds than I used to, but I'm afraid I still have no idea
what's going on around campus.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>A group of people in band blazers and hats runs by with that circle-star
thing from the center of the quad.  Sound effects.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: I've written a lot of research papers in my day, and Green
Library has always been a veritable font of information. Why don't I head over
there and see what I can find? Ted? Ted, are you there?<p>
<p>
<b>Ted VO</b>: Mmph. Mmmnm. Yes, excuse me, Kathryn I was just finishing off a
chicken salad sandwich.  Yes, why don't you see what you can find at Green.
This is Ted Koppel signing off until tomorrow night.  Triple-cast coverage of
the Stanford mayhem will continue over the next fourteen days.<p>
<p>
<i>A group of people in band blazers and hats runs by with The Dish.  Sound
effects.  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Kathryn wanders over to the edge of the stage, where Larry Bud Melman, the
Green Library portal guy, waits. Dan suggests that the Nightline desk can be
spun around to be the portal. Go for it! The curtain closes as Kathryn
approaches Larry Bud.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Larry</b>: <i>(To Kathryn.) </i> Stanford ID?<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: Sir, my name's Kathryn, and I was wondering if I could ask you
a few questions. Wait a second, aren't you Larry Bud Melman?<p>
<p>
<b>Larry</b>: <i>(Horrible acting.)   </i>Why yes I am. Mr. Letterman doesn't
use me on the show as much as he used to, so I had to take a second job here at
Green.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: I see, Mr. Melman. You wouldn't happen to know anything about
the breakup of the University, would you?<p>
<p>
<b>Larry:  </b>Funny you should ask, Kathryn. It seems that students are
clustering together in small groups, based on common interests, activities, or
just social skill. For instance, the more athletic Stanford students have
united to form &quot;Encinaland&quot; over by the gym.  And the engineers have staked out
the Terman building. They're calling it &quot;Terman Techietown.&quot; What a laugh riot!
<i>(Obnoxious laughter.)</i>  <p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  Mr. Melman, who is responsible for all this?<p>
<p>
<b>Wacky VO Guy</b>:  Green library will be closing permanently in fifteen
minutes. The current periodicals section will remain open until the December
1992 issue of <u>Playboy </u> is returned. <p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  Fifteen minutes! I still need to do some research for my
honors thesis! Larry, you've been a big help, but I've gotta find a book! Ted,
this is Kathryn Swanson-Dusenberry, from the Stanford Daily, signing off!
<i>(She tries to run through the portal thing, but Larry clotheslines
her.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Larry</b>:  I still haven't seen your ID. <i>(She whips it out and
angrily shows him.) </i> Sophomore, eh? Then what's this about an honor's
thesis?<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  It's never too early to start planning your future, Larry!<p>
<p>
<i>He lets her through and she runs off stage.  The curtain goes down behind
Larry's portal desk thing.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Larry</b>: <i>(Anti-acting.)   </i>Fifteen minutes to go!? But I'm
hungry! <i>(He stares at his watch as sound effects begin: a watch tick-tocking
and stomach growls. He loses patience.)  </i>Ah, to hell with this! I think
I'll start planning my future right now.  I'm going to Late Night Pizzaland!
<i>(He trudges off.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<p>
<b>Citizen Walsh</b><p>
<p>
<i>Curtain up on abstract multi-sets--those abstract platform things.  People
are standing around in groups.  The time is about a week after the university
breakup. Spotlight on Kathryn.  She's in Green library, trying to find a book
but, she can't find anything she needs.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Kathryn: </b><i>(To library worker.)</i>  Excuse me. I'm looking for Ovid's
<u>Metamorphosis</u>.  Could you please direct me to the proper shelf?
According to the Library of Congress system it should be at HQ31.M695.  But
it's not. In fact, nothing's there. Well, almost nothing. There are six copies
of Mikhail Gorbechev's autobiography and absolutely nothing else.   <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Shelver:</b> <i>(Slowly)</i>  Huh?  It's not there?  Where do you think it
could be?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn: </b> <i>(Getting frustrated)  </i>That's what I'm asking you.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Shelver: </b>What?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  Where it could be?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Shelver:</b>  Where what could be?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  Anything! I'm asking you where anything could be. Especially
Ovid's <u>Metamorphosis. </u><p>
<u></u><b></b><p>
<b>Shelver: </b> If it's not on the shelf, it hasn't been returned yet. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b> Are you telling me that <u>nothing </u>has been turned in?
This a library, isn't it?  Where are all the books?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Shelver: </b> Blame it on the breakup.  Ever since all those barricades went
up, no one seems to be returning their books.  What were you looking for
again?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  <i>(Now she's pissed.)  </i>What's wrong with you?  What's
wrong with this University?  Why can't I find this stupid book?  What is
Rogaine with Monoxidil?  Now I'll never get into law school.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Shelver:</b>  This isn't the law library.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  <i>(She hisses angrily.) </i> I need some help.  The break-up
has ruined this University's reputation for academic excellence.  My diploma
will be worthless, and no one seems to care!<p>
<p>
<i>Spotlight on Post Office. Random guy gets in line behind Virgil.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Guy:</b> How long you been here?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  About an hour.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Guy:</b> Moved yet?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Nope.<p>
<p>
<i>Spotlight to Ethan.  He's at a group session at the Bridge.  All the people
there are counselors.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Counselor1:</b>  So what you're saying is that you feel happy and content.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>C2:</b>  So what you're saying is that I'm saying that I feel happy and
content.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>C3: </b> I'm really happy that we're getting in touch with our feelings.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  I'm feeling that this is all a little inane.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>All Counselors:</b>  Ooooh, negativity.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  Look, I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, but don't you
understand?  We're all counselors.  We're not the ones with problems.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>C3:</b>  Everyone has problems.  Some people just don't recognize it until
it's too late.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  But where is everybody?  The phones don't ring anymore.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>C1:</b>  Phones?  They never rang.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b> Since the breakup, no one comes to group sessions.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>C2:</b>  I guess you're right.  <i>(To C1.)   </i>Jim, how does that make
you feel?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  His feelings are important, but feelings won't put this
University back together. Maybe I'm just an idealistic freshman who still
thinks yell leading isn't such a bad idea, but dammit, Jim, there's got to be a
way!<p>
<p>
<i>Spotlight to Virgil.  He's still in line, a little closer, but not quite
there.  He's whistling to pass the time.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Spotlight to Alex.  She's at the CoPo at the pizza place. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Yeah, can I get a slice of pepperoni?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Vendor:  </b>Sorry, all we have left is prawn and spicy Thai chicken. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b>Please tell me you're joking. Who comes up with these flavors?
What the hell happened to pepperoni or cheese? I'd even settle for anchovy.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Vendor:  </b>Since the University fell apart, we've had the worst time with
our distributors. Every time the trucks tried to reach Tressider, they'd be
pillaged by those roving barbarians who used to be the marching band. We
finally had to start importing leftovers from Pizza à Go Go because it's
the only thing the band wouldn't eat.  You just missed the last of the pesto.
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b>This is devastating.  I'm a New Yorker!  I've been undergoing
treatment for pepperoni dependency. You've got to have some, check in the back.
Don't make me succumb to Wilbur Food Service. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Vendor:  </b>C'mon, this pizza isn't that bad. Try the prawn... and maybe a
little key lime fro-yo to wash it down.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b><i>(Disgusted.)</i><b>  </b>Berkeley has Blondie's pizza and this
is the best we can do!? What kind of pathetic university is this?<b> </b>This
break-up sucks.<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Spotlight to Virgil at post office.  He's almost there.  As he reaches the
window, it closes with a bang.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Wait!  I've been standing here for 7 hours!  That's just today.
Please, open the window.  Help me.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Postal worker:</b>  <i>(Opens window.)   </i>I'm sorry.  We're closed now.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  But I was this close.  I'm always this close.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Postal worker:</b>  Sounds like you've got a personal problem.  Come back
tomorrow.  Or maybe the next day.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  But I really need that package.  <i>(Hands him that little
yellow slip.)  </i>It's my...it's my... iron lung!  I'll die without it,
really.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Postal worker:</b>  If we make an exception for you, we have to do it for
everyone <i>(Looks at slip) </i>, Mr. Schleprock.  Besides, it's not an iron
lung.  We looked.  It's just some underwear and a warm sweater from your
mother.  Oh, and cookies.  They weren't very good anyway.  Dad says hi.  Come
back tomorrow. <i>(Returns slip.)</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Service at the post office was weak before the break-up, but
it's actually gotten worse! I can't believe this. Nothing ever works out for
me.  I've spent the last three years struggling to pass my classes and for
what? A degree from Terman Technical Institute or Cubberly College? The
Stanford name was the one shining star in the otherwise murky heavens of my
adolescence. <p>
<p>
<i>The music starts and the four step out onto the big red assembly dot as they
sing.</i> <p>
<p>
<b>EMERGENCY ASSEMBLY POINT </b><p>
<blockquote>
<b>ETHAN:  </b>Once I was worried, neurotic, obsessed<br>
	Then a peer tutor saved me from all of this stress.<br>
	But for sanity's sake, this ridiculous break<br>
	Has torn us apart like that seven-point quake.<br>
	And now it's my turn to help someone back<br>
	Since Res Ed has obviously gotten off track.<br>
	As we say at the Bridge, the world can be cruel	<br>
	But I can't save that world if I don't save my school.<br>
<p>
<b>KATHRYN:  </b>Men find me very intimidating<br>
	'Cause all that I think of is graduating<br>
	Don't mean to be crass, but I'll do more than just pass<br>
	I'll excel all the way to the head of the class.<br>
	I was born a true leader, like Eva Peron<br>
	But my chances for fortune and fame have been blown<br>
	Since my Stanford degree has been cancelled by fate<br>
	And I might as well transfer to San Jose State.<br>
	<p>
<b>ALEX:  </b>I miss the New York City lights<br>
	On all of these dead Palo Alto nights<br>
	The Edge and the X are worse than bad sex<br>
	They don't do tequila; they serve Yuppie Becks.<br>
	How can you live in this town trapped in REM<br>
	Where you can only get pizza until 2 am?<br>
	Let's face it, I'm stuck here till classes resume<br>
	I can't go back home, 'cause mom rented my room.<br>

<b>VIRGIL:</b>   Almost has been my whole life story<br>
	Like living in Stern or purgatory.<br>
	Almost get cookies, almost get nookie<br>
	For the last three years I've been a red-shirt rookie.<br>
	My girlfriend got the mumps on prom night<br>
	I got to Full Moon at half past midnight.<br>

<b>EVERYONE ON STAGE JUMPS IN FRONT OF HIM AND SINGS:  </b>  Near!<br>

<i>Curtain closes behind the four as Virgil shrugs.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>CHORUS:  </b>I guess it's up to us to prevent another scandal<br>
	Stanford is collapsing, it's a fact we have to face.<br>
	Only four against the masses, is it just too much to handle?<br>

<b>Ethan:</b>  You know, any spelling is valid, as long as it's really you.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Do you always sound like an After-School Special, um . . . ? <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  Ethan.  I work at the Bridge.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  No!  Really?  I'm Alex--<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Like Alexander the Great?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex: </b> Shut up with the Greats already, Virgil.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  How do you know me?  Have we met somewhere before?  Did we
ever... <i>(Makes the screwing motion with fist a la &quot;Harry Met Sally&quot;.)</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Sorry.  Three years ago?  CIV?  You were the one who kept talking
about Freud.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Well, I've grown a lot since then.  For awhile there I even had
a major.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>My Freshman Advisor says I'm a Soc. machine.  What was your
major?<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil: </b><i> (Wistfully.)</i>   Poli Sci, with an emphasis on Soviet
foreign policy.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b><i>(Snickers.)   </i>That'll be <b>real</b> marketable, I bet.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>Oh yeah?  What's your major?<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>Industrial engineering.  <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b><i>(Smugly.)  <b> </b></i>Yeah, like  you're gonna get a job
with that!   Oh, yeah, I guess you will.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>So what are you going to do now, Virgil?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil: </b><i> </i> <i>(With &quot;cowboy squinting into the sunset&quot;
inflection.)</i>   Well, now I'm an undeclared Senior, looking for a good
30-unit major.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  Personal growth is the purpose of a university experience.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  But we won't have a university experience if we can't infuse
our intellectual energies.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>Come again?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  You wish.  You'd settle for once.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>Inner strife is our common enemy.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan: </b>We need a facilitator, someone to lead us and the University back
to wholeness.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  It's like Big Game in `90.  Nineteen seconds left, we go for the
two point conversion, and we miss.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  So close and yet so far away.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  The Weenies flood the field like roaches in Terra kitchen.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Game over, man.  Game over.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b> But it wasn't over.  It wasn't over because we stuck together.
Delay of game penalty on the Weenies.  We go for an onside kick, get it.  They
rough the passer. 15 yard penalty.  Into field goal range, we kick, and it's
good!!!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  So what you're saying is, the four of us, are that ball!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  I believe you misinterpreted Alex's intended metaphor.  We are
the kicker.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  Every interpretation is valid.  Maybe we're the defensive
line.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>Maybe we're the coach.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b> <i>(Idea lightbulb.)</i>   The coach? That's it, the coach! <p>
<i></i><p>
<i>&quot;Hallelujah&quot; music kicks in, light shines on sign saying &quot;Athletic
Department.&quot;</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil: </b> Bill Walsh?  Right, Bill Walsh must have the answer!<p>
<p>
<i>They go right into Bill's office (desk on the side lip of the stage).  He is
slumped over his desk,  staring intently at a football cradled in his
arms.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  Bill, what's wrong?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Bill:</b>  The breakup is killing me. I haven't even slept since I found out
about it three days ago.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>The horror!  The horror! <i>(Everyone looks at her the way you
look at stupid people in CIV.)</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Bill:</b>  My heart, it's --<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  Full of darkness?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Bill:</b>  No, broken, like Stanford.  I came here because I wanted to feel
at home again.  And now, my home is splitting up.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Coach, that's why we're here.  We want to rebuild your house.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Bill:  </b>Who the hell are you?  Bob Vila?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>That's a valid response, but we're the only people who seem to
care.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Bill:</b>  You do?  Someone really cares? <i>(He pants with excitement.)</i>
Then. . . then you must know. . . the reason . . .<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b>The reason for what?  Do you know what we can do?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Bill:</b>  <i>(Starts to pass out, but before he can, he utters the funniest
joke in this darn show.)   </i>Rosebowl. . . Rosebowl. . . <i>(He drops the
football, which rolls across the stage).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i> After a very dramatic pause (all the while the orchestra plays
bum-bum-BUM), we hear Bill snore very loudly!</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Kathryn: </b> I can't believe he fell asleep!  He was just on the
verge of revealing the secret to us, but he only got the first word out!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil: </b> It's just like those narcoleptic dogs in Sleep and Dreams!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>He's not narcoleptic. Obviously he's been rendered heart-broken
by the breakup of the University. Sleep allows us to take a break from our
problems.  We wake up refreshed and with a whole new outlook on life.  Look at
the smile on his face.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b>He's probably dreaming about Glyn Milburn.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>Well, he's given us the first clue.  So, I suppose it's up to
us to figure out this conundrum.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>Let's go find President Casper.  He's the one in charge.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>Easier said than done.  He's been out assessing the damage for
the past few days. Who knows where our poor, crest-fallen leader is now?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>There's only one thing to do.  Split up and find him.  <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  It always worked in Scooby Doo.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>OK. Kathryn, you check out Terman, Virgil hit the Row, Irving--<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>That's Ethan.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>--go see what's up at the Stadium, and I'll head for MemAud.
Meet back at the Thinker in 24 hours.<p>

<i></i><b>Sal:</b>   OK, it's your turn.<p>

<p>
<b>Sal:  </b>Genius!  Sheer genius!  Shhhh!  Do you hear footsteps?<p>
<p>
<i>Loud noises of someone falling down metal stairs in a suit of armor.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Val:  </b>Give the signal.  <p>
<p>
<b>Sal:  </b><i>(Clears his throat and whispers.)  </i>&quot;What walks down stairs,

<p>
<b>Voice:  </b>A Slinky, a Slinky.<p>

<b>Clark:  </b>You think you've got it bad?  The steam's making my hair all
frizzy.  And I just had it conditioned.  Why did we have to meet down here
anyway?<p>
<p>
<b>Val:  </b>Because the boss didn't want us to attract any attention.  We're

<p>
<i>Alex is walking along in front of red.  Mime approaches from opposite
direction.  He beckons to her.  She doesn't move, then he starts pulling at her
with invisible rope.  She doesn't move again, turns around and starts walking
away.  Mime runs around to her and starts putting up invisible mime wall.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Alex</b>: Do you enjoy courting death, Muteboy?  Just leave me alone.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Mime gives her a big mime sigh, tries to give her a paper flower.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Alex</b>: I can't make you speak, but I can make you scream.  <p>
<p>
<i>She motions to hit him, mime mimes jacking off motion at her, gives up on
her and skips away.  Suddenly Alex starts hearing &quot;bee-bops&quot; and
&quot;doodlydoodlies&quot; from behind the curtain.  Three improvisors pop up from the
trapdoor.  They are very spunky </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Improv 3</b>: <i>(Clasps hands in that oh-so-familiar way.)</i>   Hi.
Welcome to The Artland.  <i>   </i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Improv 2</b>: I'm a SIMP!  That means a &quot;Stanford Improvisor&quot; <i>(Said
slowly, accentuating each syllable, as if speaking to a foreigner.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Improv 1</b>: And I'm a SponGe!  That means a &quot;Spontaneous Generation&quot;
member <i>(Foreigner talk again.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>: And I'm annoyed.  And I don't mean the little Domino's Pizza
guy.<p>
<p>
<b>Improv 2</b>:  Can we help you with something?  Perhaps you'd like to get in
touch with your creative side?<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>: I think that all you people have been touching yourselves a little
too much already.  There's nothing that you can help me with.<p>
<p>
<b>Improv 1</b>: Oh, but we must help you! <i>(With a flourish.)</i>   This is
The Artland!  <p>
<p>
<i>Curtain opens on The Artland scene. Lots of people in colorful clothing
wander around singing, dancing, reciting dialog, etc. Avant garde blocks and
platforms are the only scenery visible. Lighting is moody and maybe the
orchestra can quietly play spooky music.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Improv 3</b>: And in The Artland, the audience member rules!  <i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>A Cappella 1</b>:  Audience??  Did you say audience? <i>(He approaches the
Improv players with condescending mannerism.)</i>   You found an audience
member and we were not notified?  How dare you, you improvising peons! <i>(A
Cappella dude slaps Improv 1 with obviously fake stage slap on both cheeks,
à la Cabaret.  Annoying, incredibly fake full-stage fight scene follows.
It is broken up after a while by our very first fake Casper, who runs on in a
sliver wig with beret and director's megaphone.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Casper:  </b><i>(Waving his arms with great angst and speaking in
Royal Shakespeare Theatre intonation.)</i>  No, no, no! My vision! You're
trampling my vision! I picture a pastoral scene! Flora, and fauna, perhaps some
livestock! Try it again! Let's take it from when she enters! <i>(Gestures to
Alex. He takes her by the arm and begins to give her instructions as stage
hands scramble in with obviously fake trees and green hills and Milky White the
cow)</i> .  Why don't you come on from <b>this</b> side of the stage and try to
remember your motivation. Pain! Suffering! Showtunes!<p>
<p>
<i>They run the scene again, only this time the orchestra plays Beethoven's
Pastoral Symphony or something, and the lighting becomes more sunny.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Improv 1</b>: Oh, but we must help you! <i>(With a flourish.)</i>
This is The Artland!  <p>
<p>
<b>Improv 3</b>: And in The Artland, the audience member rules!<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>: What are you doing? I can't believe you guys actually--<p>
   <i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Casper</b>: <i>(Re-enters, frustrated.)  </i>That's not your line!
It's not even in iambic pentameter! <i>(Snaps his fingers a few times.)</i>
Line! Line! <i>(Turns around and examines the sets.)</i>   Wait a moment! The
lighting--it's all wrong! Clive! Clive! Oh, damn the lot, I'll do it myself!
<i>(Storms off.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  <i>(Grabs AC1.)</i>   Listen, I don't have time for this
bullshit.  <p>
<p>
<b>Improv 1:</b>  I know!  We'll find a solution using free association!<p>
<p>
<b>Improv 3:  </b>It's been so long since we've had an audience member to give
suggestions, I'm kind of out of practice.  <p>
<p>
<b>Improv 2:  </b> But remember, all of this is totally improvised!  Never
before seen on this or any other stage!  And never to be seen again.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>Thank God. <p>
<p>
<b>Improv 3:  </b><i>(Does that imrpovisor clap thing.) <b>  </b></i>May I have
a suggestion for a solution, please?  Whatever comes to mind first.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  <i>(Mutters.)  </i>Asshole<p>
<p>
<b>Imp 3:</b>  Asshole, thank you.  Asshole. Bigot<p>
<p>
<b>Imp1:</b>  Bigot, homophobe.<p>
<p>
<b>Imp 2:</b>  Homophobe.  1st year law student.<p>
<p>
<b>Imp 3:</b>  1st year law student.  Keith Rabois.<p>
<p>
<b>Imp 1:  </b>Keith Rabois.  Asshole.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b> <i>(Cutting into their fun.)</i>  You're still not helping! We
need to keep the university from falling apart. <i>(Very intently.)</i>   <b>I
need to talk to President Casper.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A Cappella 1: </b> Casper?  He just left.  He's that brilliant director in
the beret.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  That was Casper? Well, take me to him <b>now</b>, and stop
blowing each other's pitchpipes!  <p>
<p>
<b>A Cappella 2</b>:  Well, not just anyone can see Casper, the leading man,
the Solo Profundo, the Funky Casper Master.<p>
<p>
<b>A Cappella 1: </b> If you're so interested in keeping the university
together why don't you go to the Big Meeting at the Quad?<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Will Casper be there?<p>
<p>
<b>A Cappella 2:  </b>No, but that's where the Commonwealth of Independent
Stanford Territories is meeting.<p>
<p>
<b>A  Cappella 1:</b>  <i>(Singing the bass line, singing a doo-wopy a cappella
song:)</i>  <p>
<blockquote>

	<i>(Cheezy scat singing, with arms akimbo!)</i><br>

<i>End of song.  Huge crash.  Gun shots.  Sound of a song being whistled off by
LSJUMB drum major.  Everyone drops to the ground and cowers.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Alex:</b> <i>(Still standing.)</i>  What the hell was that?<p>
<p>
<b>A Cappella 1</b>:  Shh.  Shh.  Quiet. <p>
 <p>
<b>A Cappella 2</b>:  It's the band.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Excuse me?<p>
<p>
<b>A Cappella 3:</b>  The band.  They're marauding again.  And they just love
to pillage A Cappella Country.  They're worse than the Huns.  They've gone
apeshit since the breakup. <i>(In hushed ghost-story tone.)  </i> Some say it's
only their restless spirit, angered because they can no longer hold all-campus
rallies, bitter because they will never be able to play at the Rose Bowl.<p>
 <p>
<b>Alex:</b>  I don't know how much more of this I can take. <i>(Sees group of
people hanging around in black and talking about angst.)</i>   Finally, New
Yorkers.  Someone I can talk to.  Hey, yo, you in the tights.  <p>
<p>
<b>Performance Artist 1</b>:<i>(Semi-Deiter.)</i>   Sky fits heaven, so ride
it!  Mother fits child, so <u>hold</u> your baby tight.  Clown wears big shoes,

 <p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you know where Casper is?<p>
<p>
<b>PA2:</b>  Egöiste!  Egöiste!  Egöiste!<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  OK.  Wrong question.  Do you know where you are?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>PM1:</b>  Your questions have grown tiresome.  Now is the time in The
Artland when we undress.  <i>(All start removing clothes and flailing
wildly.)</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b> <i>(Out of breath and at wits end.)</i>  Alright!  That does it!
Where's Casper?!  <i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Casper:</b>  <i>(Re-enters.)  </i>A Pox upon that marauding band of
band members.  They have once again ruined the aesthetic of my production!<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  President, how can you spend so much time on this play when the
university is falling apart?<p>
<p>
<b>Casper:</b>  Let it fall apart.  We've got everything we need right here in
The Artland!  <p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  That's the whole problem! While everyone is worrying about their
own part of what <i>used</i>  to be Stanford, everything that made this
university great is going to hell in a handbasket! While all you Artland people
play your little reindeer games here, what do you think is happening to the
rest of the school?<p>
<p>
<b>Casper:</b>  The play's the thing, my dear.  All the world's a stage.  You

<b>Virgil:</b>  I'm undeclared.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Lunk: </b> No way! I used to be undeclared.  Hey, what'd you do this
summer?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>I was supposed to be a windsurfing instructor in Hawaii, but I

<b>Virgil:  </b><i>(Cheezy smile.)  <b> </b></i>Hi.  You know, if I were the

the look and starts to walk away.)  </i>Look, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.
Um, the alphabet's good the way it is. Really!<p>

</i>Excellent.<i></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><p>
<i><b></b></i><b>Laura:  </b>. . .<b> </b>and, yet strangely repulsed.  <i>(He

<p>
<b>Laura:  </b> Sure.  <i>(They hold hands and look deeply into each other's

<b>Laura:  </b><i>(Peeks around Virgil, who's hand she's still holding.)   <b>

<b>Brandon: </b><i>(Another brother approaching Virgil; he could have

<b>Virgil:  </b>No, I mean, is this a closed party or what? Where are all the
non-Greeks?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Skip:  </b>Who cares?  Dude, who wants to be a non-Greek? Being in a

<b></b><p>
<b>Skip:  </b>What do you mean?  There is no more university, man.  Now it's a
24-hour party--like 7-11, but without the Tasty-Whip.  We don't have to hassle
with anything but cultivating a buzz and impressing the babes. President Casper
helped us get it together.  We elected him  Regal Chamber Brother of the new

<b>Mr. Wizard: </b> But there is another way.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Everyone on stage:</b>  Hey, it's Mr. Wizard!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Mr Wizard: </b> What's up, you crazy kids!  Before you can enter Terman
Techie Town, you must answer three simple questions.  What is your name?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  Kathryn.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Mr. Wizard:</b> What is your major?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  I'm a Modern Thought and Literature major with an emphasis in
the feminist interpretations of <u>Moby Dick</u>. <i>(Resident techies snicker
and chant &quot;fuzzy&quot; and play with their sliderules</i>. <i>Some are wearing those
cheesy snap-on sunglasses over their normal glasses.)</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Mr. Wizard:</b>  Fine.  Last question.  How much horse power can be
transmitted by a <u>shaft</u> if it turns at 100rpms and the maximum sheer
stress is limited to 4500 pounds per square inch?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b> That depends.  How long is the shaft?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Dan</b>: <i>(A techie </i>.) Ooooooooh.  Good answer!  Good answer!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Mr. Wizard:</b>  Not bad for a fuzzy!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Dan:</b> <i>(Secretively to Mr. Wizard.)</i>   Mr. Wizard, you know what
they say about fuzzy women in CS lab.  They only work with hardware!  I'd just
love to interface with her!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Mr. Wizard:</b>  Welcome, Kathryn, you may pass.  Usually we require our
guests to have a guide.  Unfortunately, all of our Karel the Robot guides are
on the blink--they're only turning left today.  So you can take Dan.  He's not
a real robot, but he plays one on TV.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Dan:</b> <i>(Winks.)  </i>Beedy beedy beedy.  I'm an RCC in <i>(whatever
dorm has block tickets).  (Trying to impress her.)  </i>You know... I've got a
laserprinter... in my room.<i> </i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  Well, maybe I'll finger you sometime and find out where you
live.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Dan:</b>  Talk dirty to me.  What can you tell me about Freud?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn: </b> Listen, I'd love to chat, but I really need to speak to
President Casper.  Is he here?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Random geek:</b> <i>(Walking by.)   </i>Of course he's here.  He's the new
President and Admiral of the Starship Techietown <i>(Giggles.)</i>   He's
infinitely amazing.  But you'll never be able to talk to him.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  <i>(Ignores geek).  </i>Look Dan, this is really important.
Can you take me to Casper? <p>
<p>
<b>Dan:  </b>But there's so much here in Techietown that I wanted to share with
you.  Fuzzy women usually don't venture out this far.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>I'm sure you've got a lot of nice pocket protectors here, but
this is important!<p>
<p>
<b>Dan:  </b><i>(Singing)  </i>Now wa-ai-ai-ait a minute!  <i>(Spoken)
</i>Techies are people too, Kathryn, and there's more to us than outward
appearances would suggest.  And today, at the ME 101 contest, we have a chance
to prove ourselves. <p>
<p>
<i>At this point, Dan guides her behind the red as the curtain opens. </i>
<i>Three ME 101 final projects that are being completed. At the rear of the
stage is a tall, imposing judge's podium with a picture of the Golden Fulcrum
on the front.  The song begins, and Dan rips off his glasses, messes up his
hair, and tears his shirt open:  Bluesy music starts and Dan breaks out into a
really sexy song as he and the rest of the Techies surround Kathyrn and explain
the way life is for Termanites.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>PROGRAMMED FOR LOVE</b><p>
<blockquote>
<b>DAN:  </b>We've been so lonely in Terman Techietown.<br>
	'Cause engineers and nerdy peers can really bring you down.<br>
	When there's no special hun to make your mainframe run,<br>
	You're left with the sad square root of only one!  (<b>ALL:</b>)  That's one!<br>
<p>
<b>TECHIE MEN CHORUS:</b><br>
	We've been integating, calculating, evaluating, but not dating;<br>
	Co-ordinating and equating, but never, never fornicating!<br>
	We've hit the books, ignored our looks, we've come to love Pascal,<br>
	But in our rooms on lonely nights, we'd rather love a gal.<br>
<p>
<b>DAN:</b>  You can't measure our manhood by the babes we've scored;<br>
	We make Fuzzy chicks amazingly sick and unequivocally bored.<br>
	So with superior genes we build big machines,<br>
	In order to achieve truly radical means.<br>

<b>TECHIE WOMEN CHORUS:</b><br>

<i>Song ends and Kathryn pushes away the dorks who have fawning over her.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Kathryn:  </b>You know, guys, I have a few dating tips for you.
<i>(All the Techies listen up and say &quot;Really,&quot; &quot;Help us,&quot; etc..)   </i>Why
don't you stop referring to women by derogatory terms?  We are women and
ladies, not girls or babes<i> (Techiewomen agree loudly!) </i>  Politeness goes
a long way.  Then maybe they'd ...uh, feel sorry for you or something, and ...
uh, maybe go out with you.  Or maybe not.<p>
<p>
<b>Dan:  </b>Do you really think that would work, Kathryn?  I mean,
<u>woman</u>.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b><i>(Sighs) <b>  </b></i>Oh, forget it.<b>  </b>So, what's
going on here anyway?  <i>(Points to the projects.)</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Dan:</b>  You are.  This is the ME101 final project day.  And if you want to
meet Casper, you're going to have to submit a project, like all the rest of us,
and <u>win</u>.  The only project choice left is to build an enormous model of
a black squirrel using only foam core and Naugahyde pelts from the big chairs
in Meyer Library.  That's why I didn't enter.  Nobody ever does <b>that</b>
project.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  No problem.  I'm quite familiar with the Naugahyde of
Meyer.<i> (She's the first contestant.)</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Random geek:</b> <i>(He's actually the second contestant in the contest).
</i>That's all well and good, but how are you going to make a small, black,
<u>animus rodentus </u> out of a foam core?  I chose to make a remote control
tracking system for my water gun so I can win in Assassin. <i>(More
giggles</i>. <i>Fake Casper takes podium.  He is a geek with big white hair in
a labcoat. (His hair isn't in the labcoat, he is)).</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper:</b>  Greetings fellow prodigies.  I'm honored to be given control of
Termanland.  I guess, from now on you can call me the &quot;Termanator.&quot;<p>
(<i>All techies laugh like the guy in </i><cite>Revenge of the
Nerds.</cite><i>)   </i>But seriously, let's begin the contest.  I'm pleased to
introduce our honored guest and judge, that mechanical engineering deity, that
master of foamcore, that genius with hair like Donny Osmond and a mind like
Doogie Howser . . . MacGyver! <i>(MacGyver music starts playing and he
enters.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Techies:  </b>We are not worthy!  We are not worthy!  <i>(Appropriate
bowing. )</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>MacGyver:  </b>Thank you, Gerhard! <b><i> </i></b>Remember kids, the winner
will get an internship with IBM <i>(Techies 'ooh') </i>, the prestigious Golden
Fulcrum award, <i>('aahh')</i>  and an intimate dinner with President Casper at
Nuts n' Mud.  Contestants, plug in your glue guns! Go!<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Kathryn whips together an exact replica of a black squirrel in under ten

<b></b><p>
<b>Dan:</b>  <i>( She has his heart!)   </i>Kathryn!  I didn't know you were so
mechanically inclined.  <p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b><i>(Pleased with herself.)   </i>Hah!  Neither did I.  I guess
there's not much to this Techie stuff after all!  <p>
<p>
<b>Dan:  </b>How did you do that?  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  My mother used to work at a Naugahyde factory in rural
Kentucky.  The strips she used to bring home to the ranch were all I had to
play with.  Do you realize how many Naugas were killed to make those very
strips?<i></i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Hannibal Lechter:  </b><i>(The third contestant, saunters up to Kathryn.)
</i>Do you still hear the screaming of the Naugas, Kathryn?  Hmm?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>MacGyver:</b>  Kathryn, this is the most technically proficient rodent I've
ever seen.  First place will <u>not</u> go to Dr. Lechter's six-foot Cuisinart
as expected!  The winner is Kathryn!!! <i>(Massive techie cheer.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Hannibal:  </b>And I was so looking forward to having Casper for
dinner, with a nice Chianti.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper:</b>  Congratulations, my little techstress.  You are the most
wonderful thing to hit Techie Town since Pascal!  What say we go to dinner?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  Sounds great.  I've been meaning to talk to you about this
breakup.  We need your help, President Casper, sir.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper: </b><i>(Casper is leering at our hero throughout, and she is
basically too oblivious to be disgusted.)</i>   Please, call me Gerhard.  Shall
we to dinner?  <i>(Gives her his arm.)  </i>  Where did you ever learn to
construct such a masterpiece?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>It was nothing. I really want to talk to you about the
university: we've got to get it back together!  You've got to help.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper</b>:  Bah.  University, Shmuniversity.  Techietown is all we need.
Within the next few years, all the fuzzies will be extinct through natural
selection.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  But you're the president.  Don't you want to get the
university back together?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper:</b>  Who needs a university?  We're being run just fine since we
sold our land to the Bookstore.  They know how to manage!  And we get these
radical sunglasses free with every text book purchased.  <i>(Refers to cheezy
snap on sunglasses over their normal glasses. Random geek runs in with

<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Random geek:</b>  President Casper, the IBM XL qwerty just crashed.  I can't
even access the plans to bulldoze the law school.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>MacGyver:  </b>And I can't find any gum or paperclips to fix it! We need
your help!<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  President Casper, please! Can't you see that we need to put
the university back together?<p>
<p>
<b>MacGyver:  </b>Leave him alone. We've got <b>important</b> things to fix. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: <i>(Angrily, to MacGyver.)</i>  Why don't you just mind your
own business! And get your hair out of the eighties!<p>
<p>
<b>Casper:  </b>Excuse me, my little microchip, I have things to attend to.
Dan, we need your expertise!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  President Casper, please! <i>(Turns to Dan.)  </i>Dan, you've
got to help me.<p>

<b>Dan:</b>  I'd love to, I really would, Kathryn. <i>(Sigh!)   </i>But our

Casper, is strapped to an inclined slab, (but facing away from the audience so
we can use an actor and a V.O.)  with a gigantic cartoon like saw hanging right
in front of him and a contraption off to the side.  There should be cheesy

<b></b><p>
<b>ET:</b>  OK, you've made you're point.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper: </b> I have friends in Haüs Mittleuropa who I am sure are
missing my famous Strüdel even as we speak. <i>(ET laughs heartily at this
suggestion).  </i>What is so funny, you foul-smelling schwïnehund? Why are
you the only one laughing?  What are you, a <u>Daily</u> cartoonist?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>ET:</b>  You are perhaps a bit too funny for your own good, Mr. President.
Let me show you what we do with funny people here.  First, we will release the
dripping hydrochloric acid, which will slowly set fire to this copy of
<u>Release</u> magazine.  The burning magazine will cause hot air to raise this
bundle of inflated condoms, which will then float up and pop on the nails
imbedded in the ceiling. As they fall, the rope will catch a lever which will
fill this fish tank with water, awakening the sleeping crab in the tank.  The
water will continue to rush in, also raising in temperature to a boil,
overflowing the tank and allowing the crab to climb out and grab the bait I
have set for him, which will then pull the vat of acid to the left.  The acid
will burn through this rope here above the saw.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper: </b> And that will kill me?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>ET:</b>  No, we still have a few bugs in the system. When the acid burns
through the rope above the saw,<b> </b>then Boris will come in and shoot you.
At any rate, you will be gone. <i>(Evil laugh #3.)</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Casper:</b>   You'll never get away with this, you-- you-- mysteriously
unnamed nemesis.  The students of Stanford will stop you.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>ET:</b>  Au contraire, Cas-pair.  They don't even know you're gone.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper: </b> What?  Why not?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>ET:</b>  Normally I would not reveal my plan to someone who is both my enemy
and the one person who could probably foil it, but since you are about to die
in my terribly over-complex killing machine... I will tell you everything.  I
have replaced your fine coffee with Folgers crystals. I have also replaced
<b>you</b> with several Casper imposters, each pandering to a different group
of students.  Conveniently enough for us, Stanford's apathetic student body
never knew what you looked like in the first place--they only knew you had
silver hair and were of some sort of Teutonic ethnicity.  Our imposters are
clever disguise artists trained at the Barbizon Presidential Academy: &quot;Be a
President, or just look like one.&quot;  No one knows you're gone, and in a few
short days, we'll take over the former Stanford University.  <p>
A-hahahahahahahaha!   <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Casper:</b>  I won't let you.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>ET:</b>  You have no choice. You will be dead. Boris, we shall leave and
return in exactly one hour when the crab has bitten through the bait.  Until
that time, adieu, Mr. Casper.<p>
<p>
<i>Exit evil-doers.</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Casper: </b> I must tell the students.  I have to get out of here.  If...
I... could... just... reach... my... utility belt... <p>

course) may enter ENCINALAND!  I'm afraid you're just too wispy to come
through.  <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: But what about <i>inner</i>  strength? The kind of strength that
makes a grown man get misty after watching Steel Magnolias, the kind of
strength that makes a man submit poetry to Aurora, the kind of strength that
tells a man that it's OK to sing Little Mermaid songs in public?<p>
<p>
<i>Guards shrug shoulders and look to each other for clues.</i><p>

<b>Pumped 1</b>: I don't, I, I'm not--<p>
<p>
<b>Pumped 2</b>: The wise ones. I think we need the wise ones. Open the gate!<p>
<p>
<i>Curtain goes up, and we see Encinaland. There are trophies scattered about,
and lots of people walk around in red and white clothing and weight belts.  One
guy is throwing a football at the Time Out for Tuition thing with the hole in
it.  Everyone is very pumped up, with sweatshirts stuffed with fake muscles.
People are so buff they have to turn sideways to pass each other and get
through doorways. four or five exercise bicycles are lined up against the back
curtain. The guards escort Ethan to a clot of yell-leader looking people.</i><p>
<p>
<b>Pumped 1</b>: <i>(Shoves Ethan toward yellers.)</i>  Wise ones! Wise ones!
<i>(Gets their attention.)</i>   He talks funny.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan: </b><i>You're</i>  the wise ones!?<p>
<p>
<b>Yell Leader General</b>: <i>(Indignantly and yelling through a little
megaphone.) </i>This is Encinaland, and in Encinaland, we get the respect we
deserve! But we've got a job to do. <p>
<p>
<i>Yellers position themselves and do the &quot;Ready? O-K!&quot; thing.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Yellers</b>: <i>(Gesturing appropriately.)</i>  WHAT   IS   YOUR   NAME!?<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  Well, my parents named me Hank, but I didn't feel that it
represented who I am, who I've become.  So I changed it to Ethan.  <p>
<p>
<b>Yellers:</b> <i>(Translating to Guards.)</i>   Gimme an E!  Gimme a T!
Gimme an H!  Gimme an A!  Gimme an N!  ETHAN!  <i>(Guards nod.)</i> <p>
<p>
<b>Pumped 1</b>:  Has he come here to increase his pumpitude?<p>
<p>
<b>Yellers</b>:  WHY   HAVE   YOU   COME   HERE?<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  Well, you see, ever since the University broke up, a few other
students and I have been trying to find out just how it happened. We're trying
to get some information about the split and what we can do to get our school
back together.<p>
<p>
<b>Yell Leader General:</b> <i>(Through megaphone.)</i>  Nope, he's not here to
work out. Toss his bony ass outta here!<p>
<p>
<i>Guards pick up Ethan like a suitcase: one grabs him by the arm, the other by
a leg, and they begin to carry him offstage.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Ethan</b>: <i>(Panicking.)</i>   Wait a second, wait a second! I wasn't
finished. AND to work out! I came here to get some information about why the
University broke up, to see what I can do to get it back together, AND to work
out! Did you hear me? AND to work out!<p>
<p>
<i>Guards, after hesitating a moment, put him down.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Yell Leader General: </b><i>(Through megaphone.)</i>  You don't <i>look</i>
like you work out!<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  I've been sick.<p>
<p>
<b>Yell Leader General: </b><i>(Through megaphone.)</i>  Look, I may be a dumb
bimbo, but I'm not <i>that</i>  dumb! Bounce him out, boys! <i>(Guards grab him
by the arms and are about to drag him away when he gets a marvelous
idea...)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  Who said anything about dumb bimbos? Did I say I think you're
dumb? Did I say I think you're a bimbo? No! <p>
<p>
<i>He tries to shake off the guards and can't. Yell Leader General nods that
it's OK to let him loose. He approaches her with a soothing expression on his
face.</i> <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: I can see that you exercise your body here in Encinaland, but
what needs exercising is your self-image!  What's your name?  <p>
<p>
<b>Marnie:  </b>Marnie.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>Marnie,<b> </b>it breaks my heart to see someone who is so down
on herself! Look at yourself! You use your megaphone as a crutch to get people
to listen to you, you wear the school colors in a desperate attempt to form a
bond with your fellow students... <i>(He takes her hand</i> .)  I think that
deep down inside, there's a wonderful person struggling to break through this
dumb bimbo shell you've built around yourself. I think you'll feel better if
you talk it out...<i>(Music swells.)</i><p>

<i>Song ends to a flurry of applause. Yell Leader General has melted
completely. She sniffles and clutches Ethan tightly.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  There now! Doesn't that feel better? <i>(She sniffles in the
affirmative.)</i>  <p>
<p>
<i>Yell Leader general steps back and begins to hold the megaphone up to her
lips. She reconsiders, and tosses it aside.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Yell Leader General</b>:<b> </b>Thank you, Ethan, thank you so much! I feel
so much better. <i>(She notices the guards watching her</i> .)  Guards, I think
you can go now. <i>(They take off.</i> )<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: I'm glad I could help you out.  In fact, I've never felt so
fulfilled, uh ... in my role as counselor and friend.  Now, do you think you
could do <i>me </i> a favor? I really need to talk to someone who knows what's
going on with the break-up thing.<p>
<p>
<b>Yell Leader General</b>: Well, President Casper is supposed to be giving a
speech in a few minutes. He moved his office into Encinaland because he said
that this is his favorite part of campus! I could probably get him to talk to
you afterwards.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: That would be great! Everyone's been trying to get in touch with
Casper ever since the breakup was first announced. I tried calling him a few
times, but I never got through, nobody has. Let me think, what was that message
I kept getting... <i>(He rubs his chin and stares off into space. We
hear:)</i><p>
<p>
<b>VO</b>: All the Stanford Presidents are busy now. Please remain on the line.
The first available Stanford president will take your call in the order in
which it was received. This is a recording.<p>
<p>
<b>Yell Leader General</b>: He's about to come on! Let's go!<p>
<p>
<i>They cross the stage to where an elevated podium has been set up. The PA
blares an orchestrated, march-sounding version of &quot;Let's Get Physical&quot; and fake
Casper (the Fuck Drugs guy) walks to the podium. He's wearing a silver wig
&amp; the requisite &quot;Fuck Drugs&quot; tank top. The Encinaland crowd goes wild,
chanting &quot;President Casper! President Casper!&quot; etc.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Fuck Drugs Guy</b>: <i>(Waves his hands, waiting for the crowd to shut
up.)</i>  Fuck drugs! Fuck drugs. Fuck <b>drugs</b>!<i> </i> Drugs? Fuck 'em.
<i>(Crowd is mesmerized</i>.) Thank you, my press secretary will answer any
questions you may have. <i>(He exits.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Secretary</b>: <i>(Gal in dark suit.) </i>  Yes, do you have any
questions?<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: Excuse me, but why did the University break up? And why did
President Casper move to Encinaland? What's the deal?<p>
<p>
<b>Secretary</b>: <i>(Oratorically.</i> ) All I'm authorized to say is that the
University breakup was done to benefit the residents of Encinaland. We're
confident that the Bookstore is best suited to manage your territory, and it
was for this reason that President Casper suggested you turn control of your
property over to that body. I should remind you that the president <b>did</b>
choose to locate his office here, in the hope of better serving your needs.  <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: <i>(Getting annoyed</i> .)  To better serve the needs of
<i>Encinaland</i>!? We cut the art department to expand the Stairmaster fleet,
and Casper's worried about better serving the needs of <i>Encinaland</i>!? That
doesn't make sense! Bring him back! I want to talk to Casper! And what was up
with that speech!? He didn't mention fucking drugs in any of those articles the
<i>Daily</i>  ran last year! And come to think of it, he didn't look half as
pumped as he does now! Wait a second! Are you sure that's the--<p>
<p>
<b>Secretary:</b> <i>(Interrupts, panicked.)   </i>You there, the vocal one!
Are you a resident of Encinaland? <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: No, I happen to be--<p>
<p>
<b>Secretary</b>: Then you should be especially interested in the new
Encinaland regulation that all non-Encinalanders are to be deported immediately
unless they can best Blitzkrieg, President Casper's personal bodyguard, in a
contest of strength.<p>
<p>
<i>Guards grab Ethan.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  Shit! This is just like sixth grade gym class! <p>
<p>
<b>Secretary</b>: So let the contest begin!<p>
<p>
<i>American Gladiators time. The crowd disperses and the podium is wheeled
away. Ethan is suited up in assorted pads and a lacrosse helmet, same for
hulking guard. They are each given a giant Q-tip and placed on a small platform
that somehow is elevated above the stage. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Secretary</b>:  Whoever remains longest on his platform is the winner! <i>
</i><p>
<i></i> <p>
<i>They fight for a bit.  The contest is obviously one-sided.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Ethan</b>: <i>(To this opponent.)  </i> Say, isn't that Omar Tomas Wasow
<i>(Or whatever Daily columnist from next year would be most threatening to
Encinaland people)  </i>hitting on your girlfriend?<p>
<p>
<i>Guard bends over to look for Omar. Ethan swabs the side of his helmet with
the giant Q-tip. Squeek, squeek sound effect and he plummets to the stage like
a wounded duck. Ethan jumps down, victorious. Buff crowd is pissed. They boo
Ethan, and yell things like &quot;Cheaters never win&quot; and &quot;No fair, pencil-neck.&quot;
</i><p>
<p>
<b>Crowd</b>: Get him!<p>
<p>
<i>The crowd grabs Ethan, roughing him up for a brief moment (maybe Blitzkrieg
can give him noogies) in slo mo, and then Ethan escapes and jumps on the lead
exercise bike. Buff guards jump on the others. They all pedal like mad as chase
music plays. Ethan finally realizes he's not getting anywhere, jumps off the
bike, and runs offstage.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Guard on bike</b>: Dammit! Outsmarted again! <p>
<p>
<b>Yell Leader General</b>: <i>(Gushingly after Ethan.</i> )  What a man! <p>
<b>303 lbs.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b><i>	</i></b><i>Starts in front of red.  One at a time, the four main
characters find their way to center stage: Ethan gets there first from stage
left and nervously checks her watch; Virgil and Alex come up through the trap
door; Kathryn comes from the back of Mem Aud and emerges out of the audience.
On stage there is a person in the Thinker pose with a text book in his hands.
Ethan sees him  first.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Ethan:  </b>The Thinker!  I guess this is the place.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b><i>(Surprised.)  </i>  We're gonna meet here?  Whatever! <i>(With
a shrug.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Virgil:  </b> Hey guys.  I thought we said . . . Never mind.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>There you are.  <p>
<p>
<b>Thinker:  </b><i>(Stands up.)  <b> </b></i>Will you shut the hell up?  I've
got the M-CAT  on Saturday!   <i>(Storms off.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Virgil:   </b>Let's get outta here.<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Now the four left face and start walking in place and the scenery moves
behind them .  It's funny.</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  It's about time you arrived.  I thought we synchronized our
watches.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  I would have come sooner, but Blitzkrieg beat me up and took my
watch.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>Did he take your lunch money, too?<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan: </b> <i>(Sheepishly.)  </i>Yes. <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Yeah, you think that's bad?  They took my clothes and dressed
me up like George Michael.  But at least I found Casper.  I mean Alex and I
both found him, or them ...<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn: </b> You went through Techietown on the way here?<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>No.  Casper's in Greece.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>And in The Artland.  Only he wasn't the same--<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>But I saw him in Encinaland.  He spoke very eloquently on the
dangers of drugs. I haven't been so riveted since Whoopi Goldberg's Centennial
speech.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b><i>(Complains.) <b> </b></i>I've never been riveted.  <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan: </b>Then his press secretary told me that Encinaland has been sold to
the Bookstore, and it was all Casper's idea. <p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn: </b>  The Bookstore bought Techietown, too! <b> </b>He couldn't
have been in all four places at the same time.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  No shit.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b><i>(Frustrated.)  </i>That's what I've been trying to tell you!
I saw Casper twice, and he was not the same guy.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b><i>(To Virgil.)   </i>Was your Casper a buff, African-American
man with silver hair?<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>The silver hair sounds familiar... But they're not the same
guy.  Yours must have been fake.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b><i>(To Virgil.)   </i>I find that a potentially flawed thesis.
Perhaps <u>yours</u> was the counterfeit Casper. <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>Can we really know anything for sure when we're all so wrapped
up in our own interpretations and cultural biases of our shared experience?  <p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>Shut up.<b>  </b>It doesn't matter anyway.  Casper doesn't want
to help us.  He obviously doesn't feel like dealing with the students anymore,
so he sent out imposters to do his work.  We'll have to do this without him. <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>So, what do we do?<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>I know!  Let's go to the ASSU.  They always handle the
important things.  <p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>Two problems, Ethan.  A: The ASSU never did anything in the first
place.  And secondly:  they're not even the ASSU anymore.  They changed their
name to the Commonwealth of Independent Stanford Territories: the C.I.S.T.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>Where did you find this out?<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>It was sung to me in four-part harmony.  <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>If we can convince them to put aside their differences and
re-unite, all our problems will be solved!<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b><i>(Gives him the look and a sigh.)  </i>They hold U.N. meetings
in the Quad.  It's the only neutral area left on campus that hasn't been
claimed by any one group.  Let's hit it.<p>
<p>
<i>The curtain opens to reveal the U.N. meeting and our heroes are there.  A
big sign says &quot;Commonwealth of Independent Stanford Territories.&quot;   People are
milling about, holding political convention picket signs with the different
lands marked down (the ones we've been to, and others including: Genderland,
Branner, Multi-Cultural Land, Overseas Colonies, Slo-Mo Land, Dolliewood,
Resumé-Packers' Land, etc.).  There are a few Super-heroes (especially
Aquaman), as well as Band members (especially the Viking guy) milling around.
People are throwing paper, like at Flicks.  Our four main people herd
together.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Viking Guy:  </b>You, Muwekma-Guy-Ruk, do you have any new business?
<p>
<p>
<b>Muwekma-Guy-Ruk:  </b>New business?  Did we ever finish our old business?<p>
<p>
<b>Slo-Mo lady:  </b><i>(Painfully slow Droopy voice.)<b>  </b></i>As the
delegate from Slo-Mo Land, which includes the Post Office Republic, Cowell
Country--<p>
<p>
<b>Viking Guy:  </b>Yeah , yeah, we know, and the Old Union Confederation.
Now, what's your point?  What do you want to propose?<p>
<p>
<b>Slo-Mo lady:</b>  <i>  </i>That there's no need to rush!<p>
<p>
<b>Gender girl:  </b>Do you have something to add, Aqua<u>man</u>?<p>
<p>
<b>Aquaman:  </b>I'd like Deguerre Pool and the Theta Chi shower to be moved
next to Lake Lag.  If the drought returns, I'll be helpless and unable to use
my telepathy to call on my fish friends.  <i>(The telepathy sonar sound effect
here!)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Viking Guy:  </b>Fine, my amphibious amigo.  <p>
<p>
<b>Mem Chu Construction Worker Lady:</b>  <i>(Enters.)   </i>I hope I'm not
interrupting, but I've come here to address the C.I.S.T. on behalf of the
University Construction Union.  Now that we've finished repairing Mem Chu, we
need a new project.  We have to keep building -- it's the law of perpetual
construction.  <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  <i>(Still dressed in leather.)   </i>Just like the Doozers in
Fraggle Rock.<p>
<p>
<b>Mem Chu Construction Worker Lady:   </b>Right. <b> </b>Today we're pouring
concrete at Felafel Junction over in Ecoland.   <p>
<p>
<b>Stanford Lady Cop:</b>  <i>(Runs in.)   </i>Did you see three skatepunks run
through here?<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Skateboarding is <u>not</u> a crime.<p>
<p>
<b>Stanford Lady Cop:</b>  It is if it's on my beat.  It destroys property,
takes up university space that other people want to use, and makes a lot of
noise.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Then we should outlaw sorority rush too.  <i>(Rim shot.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Virgil:  </b>Excuse me!  This is all well and good, but aren't we
forgetting something?  Shouldn't we be getting Stanford back together?  Do you
want this place to be in chaos forever?<p>
<p>
<b>Stanford Lady Cop: </b> Chaos?  What you see before you is the biggest and
most impressive political organism this school has ever known. <p>
<p>
<i>The Cop, Muwekma-Guy-Ruk, Delt cowboy, Mem Chu construction worker lady, and
Virgil take their places for this rousing song.  A disco ball shaped like a
cyst come down.</i><p>

<i>Right after the song, Tofu gets killed.  She will be killed by a bad guy in
a dark coat with a poisoned blowdart from the side of the stage.  There is a
cool sound effect, too  as the body count escalates.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Eco 1:  </b>Oh, my God.  Tofu's been assassinated.<p>
<p>
<b>Eco 2:  </b>I think the blow dart came from the sixth floor of the Bookstore
Depository.<p>
<p>
<b>Eco 3:  </b>What about that grassy knoll?  There could have been a second
blower!<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Pandemonium breaks out once more!</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Alex</b>:  Tofu must have known too much for her own good.  Looks like
there's been a massive cover-up.  <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>Dammit, it's time to rip the covers off.  As much as I hate to
say it, we gotta go to the Bookstore.  Come on.  <i>(Both exit.)</i><p>

<i>Ted Koppel's desk rolls out on stage again.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i> </i><b>Ted:  </b>This just in: a recent Nightline poll indicates that 86%
of Stanford students polled believe that Branner sucks.  <i>(Wait until hell
freezes over and the audience recovers.)  </i>And 14% are undecided.  Now back
to our regularly scheduled program.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Paradise by the Bookstore Light</b><p>
<p>
<i>Front of red.  All four of our heroes meander across stage from left,
They're in front of the Bookstore.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: Once we get inside the Bookstore, I'm going to try to do a
little research.  <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:<i> (Rolls his eyes.)</i>  Come on, can't your honors thesis wait
until we figure out what the Bookstore's doing buying up all the territories?<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: No, that's not it.  There's one thing I still don't understand.
Remember when we were back at Bill Walsh's office and he said--<p>
<p>
<i>At this point, the AmEX  person and the Ring Woman attack Ethan screaming
&quot;flight vouchers,&quot; &quot;14 or 18 carat gold rings,&quot; &quot;buy, buy, buy,&quot; etc.  Ethan
takes out a rape whistle from the Bridge and blows it loudly until the venders
run off like so many cockroaches in a dark kitchen suddenly filled with bright
light.  The curtain opens to reveal the Bookstore.  Bookstore Manager lady in
suit with red &amp; white scarf should be downstage getting a manicure.</i><p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: I'm going to go check the gardening section. <i>(She walks
away.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: <i>(To the audience.)</i>   The gardening section? <p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>Let's try to find out where the manager's office is.  I want to
see what they know about Tofu's death.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>I'll keep an eye out for blow darts.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Alex and Virgil start searching around talking to people quietly. Ethan
wanders around a bookstand, browsing through some books. A Gorby-looking guy in
a navy-blue suit has his back turned to the audience. Ethan looks up as the guy
looks around guiltily and then very obviously tries to stuff an Oxford English
Dictionary down his pants. A bookstore narc [in red windbreaker w/ NARC taped
in big letters on the back]  runs over and grabs him by the arm, spinning him
around to face the audience. It's Gorbachev!</i><p>
<p>
<b>Narc</b>:  Gotcha! Caught you red-handed! You didn't think you could get
away with this, did you? Wait a second...you're Gorbachev! But, Mr. former
Soviet President, why were you trying to stuff a dictionary down your pants?<p>
<p>
<b>Gorby</b>: <i>(Smiles weakly and shrugs guiltily.)</i>  No one is buying my
book.<p>
<p>
<b>Narc</b>:  I'll let it slide this time, punk, but keep your nose clean.
<i>(Narc looks offstage.)</i>   Hey! You, with the Laserprinter under your hat!
<i>(Runs off.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Kathryn re -enters, bubblin' with vim and vigor. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: Hi guys, and gal.  I have exciting news!   From the beginning,
I was confused about this whole &quot;Rosebowl&quot; thing. What did Bill Walsh mean when
he said &quot;Rosebowl&quot;? So I checked in a bunch of gardening books. But, nothing!
Then I realized... it might be a literary  reference, so I checked a few
Medieval Welsh balladeers, and found an obscure yet provocative mention of a
bowl of roses the Celts worshipped in the Outer Hebrides. <i>(Ecstatically</i>
.) I think we'll find our answer in Ireland! Let's go back to the AmEx woman,
get our $129 flight vouchers, and GO!<i>  </i>What's wrong? Are you afraid of
flying? <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  Kathryn, the Rose Bowl is a football game in Pasadena. <p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  But we don't have a football team anymore.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil</b>: <i> </i>And if there's no Stanford football team, then Bill
Walsh won't ever be able to lead it to the Rose Bowl.  More importantly, no
football means no Big Game.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: <i>(Shrugs.)</i>   I wish somebody had told me that a few hours
ago.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil</b>: Don't worry, Kathryn, we got directions to the manager's office.
<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:  </b>I grabbed the cashier and she sang like a canary. This is
starting to make sense! What if it was the Bookstore that engineered the whole
breakup!<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>At this point, Bookstore narcs in red windbreakers hiding behind  some
mannequins in Stanford apparel begin to creep up on our heroes, moving the
mannequins with them, listening intently to the explanation.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Ethan</b>:  Wait a second, why would the Bookstore want to break
Stanford up?<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  Remember what Tofu said? That was the only way they could buy up
enough Stanford land to build a superhighway through campus to their vacation
home! What a bunch of--<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  Greedy, non-non-profit bastards! <i>(Sees the surprised looks on
their faces.)</i>  Oops, sorry.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  I think our next logical course of action would be to foil the
Bookstore's plan!  <i>(Randomly.)</i>   So fast.<p>
<p>
<i>Bookstore narcs, who have been closing in on the group, now jump our heroes.
</i> <p>
<p>
<b>Narc #1</b>: Not so fast! <i>Ha ha ha!  </i> You sniveling rebate-hounds
almost beat the Bookstore, but not quite!<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil</b>: <i>(Pissed.)  </i>Dammit, this always happens to me!<p>
<p>
<b>Bookstore Manager</b>: You may have figured out our nefarious plan, but I'm
afraid you'll never live to stop us! Bring out the wrapping paper!<p>
<p>
<b>Narc #2</b>: No, you can't mean--<p>
<p>
<b>Bookstore Manager</b>: Yes! We'll wrap them up and send them to New Jersey!
<i>(Narcs slip coils of wrapping ribbon over the four main characters' heads,
tying them to chairs and a big, sticky bow stuck to their foreheads, as they
all scream &quot;Noooooo!!!!!!!!.&quot;)  </i> <p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b>Wait a minute!  Did you kill President Casper and Dean Montoya
or did you just kidnap them?<p>
<p>
<b>Narc #1:  </b>Yes!  Next question!<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Virgil</b>:  Did you use our rebate money on this pathetic plan to build a
highway?<p>
<p>
<b>Narc #2</b>:  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Fool! We squandered your rebate money on
three new Lexuses and another Winnebago!<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  So where did you get the money to buy up all the Stanford
territories?<p>
<p>
<b>Bookstore manager</b>:  Ha ha ha, you stupid Stanford students! <b>I</b>
gave them the money.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  You? Who are you?<p>
<p>
<b>Bookstore Manager</b>:  My name is Annette Funicello <i>(Or if a man,
Englebert Humperdink.).</i>.  No, not that one!  Anyway, I represent the
students of the University of California at Berkeley! <i>(Demonic laughter and
a thunderclap as she rips off her red &amp; white scarf to reveal a blue &amp;
gold one.)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Statler</b>: <i>(In juliet.)</i>   The University of California at
Berkeley!<p>
<p>
<b>Waldorf</b>:  <i>(Sarcastically)</i>  What a surprise! Of course it was Cal!
This is Gaieties!<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Statler</b>: They had <b>me</b> goin'! I thought for sure it was
those Japanese investors!    <p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Narc #1</b>:  The highway scam wasn't even our idea! Cal asked us if
they could buy up territories in our name, and in return, we get a cool freeway
to the vacation home in central California!<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>: Did you say the Bookstore vacation home is in <b>central</b>
California? Tofu said the highway only went North. To Cal!<p>
<p>
<i>Narcs freak out. They've been double-crossed.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Narc #2</b>:  The highway goes to Cal!? <i>(Points at Manager.)
</i>You'd better not be double crossing us! <i>(The narcs close in on
manager.</i> )  <p>
<p>
<b>Bookstore Manager</b>: Too late! Enough Stanford land has already been sold
to Cal that the students of the University of California at Berkeley now have a
controlling interest in Stanford!  But I think you're far too confident.
<i>(Reaches into jacket and pulls out a pistol-shaped price scanner.)
</i>Prepare to be scanned.<p>
<p>
<i>Evil bookstore manager aims the scanner at each of the narcs heads. A
&quot;bloop&quot; sound effect signals that each has been scanned, and they in turn fall
dead to the stage. He approaches the four main characters.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Bookstore Manager</b>: I'm going to enjoy this. You Stanford students
think you're <b>so</b> smart because you can read, and write and do simple
arithmetic, but I tell you, you're not. We stole your school right out from
under your stinkin' golf shoes. You guys think you're so clever, but it was you
Stanford students who sold your school to Cal! <i>(Sound effect: a deep,
ghostly howl/chortle.)   </i>What the hell was that?<p>
<p>
<i>Ghost of Leland Stanford, Sr., swoops onto the stage. A person is wearing a
sheet over himself, (like Charlie Brown did  every Halloween) and painted on
the sheet is the gruff visage of Leland Stanford, Sr., as seen in the 1991
froshbook. The face should be about four feet high, filling up the entire front
of the sheet. The voice of the ghost will be done as a voice over. It should be
a deep, ghostly, serious, yet strangely neighborly voice. All characters on
stage shake violently in fear, but they all stay where they are until the ghost
has finished speaking.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Ghost VO</b>:  I am the ghost of Leland Stanford, Senior, and I have
come to warn you of the horrific doom that awaits you. <i>(Points at Bookstore
manager.) </i> In the charter of Stanford University I specifically prohibited
any Stanford land from ever being sold.  I'm going to have to cause you all
such great pain and suffering that you would welcome an atomic wedgie as
merciful relief from the horrible anguish that I shall rain down upon you like
fire from the heavens! Boogety boogety boo!<p>
<p>
<i>Pandemonium. Everyone , including the manager, runs off screaming</i>
<i>frantically, begging forgiveness, singing Kum-Ba-Yah, etc.The main
characters are tied to chairs, they can't run off, but they try to scoot their
chairs away from the ghost at center stage. As soon as the four main characters
are the only ones left with the ghost, we hear:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>President Casper</b>:  <i>(Ghost pulls off sheet to reveal--yes, it's
true--President Casper! Yay!)  </i> I'm too sexy for this sheet.<i>(Or if Pres.
would prefer:   </i>&quot;The things I do to keep my university together!&quot; <i>At
this point, the audience goes nuts. President Casper unties our heroes. ) </i>
Here, let me help you with that.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>It's Casper the Friendly Ghost.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  Thank you for saving our lives! You got here just in time.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil</b>:  We've been looking for you all over the place!  Are you all
right?<p>
<p>
<b>President Casper</b>:  Yes, I'm fine. The Weenies have held me captive for
the last two weeks, but thanks to my utility belt, I was able to narrowly evade
death a few minutes ago and create a disguise from an old sheet. But that's not
important right now. We need a plan to save Stanford.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  That's right! Control of Stanford still rests in the hands of
Cal students! <p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  President Casper, if I remember correctly from those stories in
the Daily, you were once a faculty member at Cal. Is there anything you recall
from your days at Berkeley that would help us ruin their plan?<p>
<p>
<i>President Casper scratches his chin in deep thought and stares into space.
The PA slowly swells with the sound of &quot;Truckin&quot; and he gets an idea.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>President Casper</b>:  Well, I remember that there was one guy the
students were always talking about. His name was Julio Ramirez. No, that's not
it. Joey Hernandez... Jackie Garbanzo? No, maybe it was--<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil</b>:  Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead!<p>
<p>
<b>President Casper</b>:  Yes, that's it. Cal students used to think that man
was the greatest. <p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  They still do.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: He's revered as a somewhat god-like figure. But how does that
help us?<p>
<p>
<b>President Casper</b>:  I think I know how we can get our university back!
I'll need a pen and some paper.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  I had a piece of paper, but I gave it to Waldo.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil</b>:  Waldo? Where's Waldo? <i>(House lights come up to
half-power.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Announcer Voice: </b> Good evening and welcome to the first annual audience
participation segment of Big Game Gaieties: Where's Waldo? <i>(Spotlights swirl
around audience.)  </i>Help President Casper foil the evil Weenie plot by
finding Waldo somewhere in the audience. Speak up once you've spotted him!<p>
<p>
<i>Planted somewhere in the audience, hopefully toward the back, is  Gabe
Miller all dressed up as Waldo. Kathryn, Virgil, Ethan, and Alex are on stage
looking out into the audience for Waldo. As soon as they've spotted Waldo, they
shout out to him. He shouts back from the audience.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Kathryn</b>:<i>(Sees Waldo.)</i>  Waldo! We need that piece of paper
I gave you before!<p>
<p>
<b>Waldo</b>: <i>(Holds up piece of paper and shouts back.)</i>   This one?<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: Yeah, that's it! Bring it on up here!<p>
<p>
<i>Waldo makes his way to the stage from the audience with the piece of paper.
Someone pulls a pen from the shirt pocket of one of the scanned Bookstore
people who is lying around semi-dead on the stage.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>President Casper</b>:  I'll take that! Thanks. <p>
<p>
<i>Waldo exits. Casper begins to write, using Ethan's back as a desk.</i><p>

<p>
<b>Virgil</b>: <i>(After annoying mike feedback squeal, first few notes from
Purple Rain heard in background.)</i>   Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to get through this thing called life.  Electric word life, it means
forever and...<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  What he means to say is that Jerry Garcia is dead.  Gone.  Later.
See 'ya.  Sayonara.  Au revoir.  Ciao...<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  But, rest assured, he died for a reason.  His life was a
message.  It told us to love each other, to experience the world through a
twisted, yet heightened sense of consciousness, to enjoy life for what it
is...<p>
 <p>
<b>Alex</b>:  Yeah, a 3,000 mile drive in a badly-painted Volkswagon bus.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  Even in death he taught us.  He taught us not to take the
little things in life for granted...<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  Like showering and underwear...<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  But let me tell you...right now, Jerry is one grateful dude.
He's up there, high in the sky, jammin' with St. Stephen.  We empathize with
your pain, and we have a way of easing it somewhat--we have a petition.
<i>(Holds up petition like the 10 commandments--big cheer from crowd).</i>
This is a petition to add Jerry's face to Mount Rushmore. <i>(Small reaction.)
</i> And to change the national anthem to &quot;Casey Jones.&quot; <i>(Small reaction.)
</i> And to make Big Game Day of every year National Jerry Day. <i>(Jubilance,
people rush for petitions and our four heroes walk around, getting signatures
as the Cal students sing.)</i><p>

	We've been followin' you all over the land.<br>
	Your songs we never really understood,<br>

<b>Cal #1:</b>  What are we going to do now?  If we start bootlegging Phish

<p>
<b>Cal #2</b>:  I love you, man.<p>

<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Cal #3:  </b>Where did we park, man?<p>
<p>
<b>Cal #4: </b> Didn't we park in the Goofy section?<p>
<p>
<b>Cal #3:  </b>I think so. Cal guy, take me away! <p>

<b>Ethan:  </b>Save Jerry's kids.  Sign our petition.  Save Jerry's kids.
<i>(Cal's 3 and 4  sign his petition and then exit as audience guffaws. Our
four are now near the front of the stage.)  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  I don't understand how any of this can work.  Does President
Casper really believe that an institution as respected as the University of
California at Berkeley would fall for such a simplistic prank?  I mean aren't
they going to read this petition before they sign their school away?<p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  Just look at these people, Kathryn. They think Jerry Garcia is
dead just because we sent them a few well-written letters from a laser
printer.<p>
<p>
<i>Assorted vendors walking around.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Cal #5:  </b>Doses!  Doses!  Ice cold doses!<p>

herbs and spices.<p>
<p>
<b>Announcement woman:  </b><i>(She speaks into the mike on the podium.)

Ethan, who takes ridiculous self-defense class position in front of guy's face
and yells &quot;NO&quot;.  Guy stares back with blank expression.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>: <i>(Picking up a Daily Cal.)</i>   You'll never believe this--they
canceled classes.  Their professors are organizing teach-ins on the influence
of the Grateful Dead on the writings of Tom Clancy.<p>
<p>
<b>Virgil: </b> I overheard a few Cal students saying that it was a conspiracy
plot!<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: <i>(Reading newspaper.)  </i> It seems that 90% of  Berkeley

The other ten percent thought he was a flavor of ice cream.  <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil</b>:  How could you spike someone's PCP?  What could you spike PCP
with--more PCP? <i>(Cal students wander on.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Cal #8</b>:  He's dead, man.  He's gone.  And nothing's gonna bring him

<p>
<b>Cal #9:  </b>I feel like someone just stole my face right off my head.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  What a bunch of moe-rons!<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan</b>:  Alex, have a little sympathy.  These people are going through a
very tough time.  When we staged Jerry's death, we robbed them of everything
they've invested their emotions in.  What they fear isn't the loss of a musical
hero, but the loss of a support system.  Just look at them.  I'm afraid we have
no choice but to tell them the truth.<p>
<p>
<b>Alex:</b>  What, are you high?  And just hand them Stanford? Why don't you
throw in John-Edward, cain III and the shopping center while you're at it?<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:</b>  Yeah, you're right.  Fuck 'em.<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn:  </b><i>(She's been counting the signatures on the petition and now

love theme.  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>Ted: </b> Good evening. I'm Ted Koppel and this is <i>Nightline</i>.
Tonight we continue our look at the crisis on the Farm.  Earlier today, a group
of four Stanford students foiled an ill-fated and ill-planned hostile takeover
plot by the University of California at Berkeley.  Stanford now faces the
arduous task of resolving petty differences and reuniting to resume their
common quest for knowledge.  The temporary union of the Commonwealth of
Independent Stanford Territories, or CIST, has gone the way of the Soviet
Union, the COP, and Erik Estrada.  We go now to live coverage of the
Phoenix-like rebirth of my alma mater, Leland Stanford Junior University.<p>

<i>His desk disappears as it did before and the curtain opens for the last time

Everyone is joining together to tear down the walls, block by block.  Dan the
techie guy and the Yell Leader General are working side by side  with Kathryn

<i></i><p>
<b>Kathryn:</b>  I can't believe it worked!  The fake Caspers have all been

<b>Virgil:</b>  Right, with Cal stoned and trying to tie-dye a death shroud for
a 300 pound acid-head who's only <u>mostly</u> dead, we're sure to win Big
Game. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  Yeah, I'm just glad our school's getting back together. After all
that selfish territorial bullshit, everyone's finally willing to work as a
team. Everything will be perfect as soon as we finish tearing these walls
down.<p>
<p>
<i>&quot;Don't You Forget About Me&quot; slowly builds under the following
speeches.</i><p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>:  I just wanted you all to know that you're invited to the
reading of my new honors thesis: &quot;The Implications of Calculus in the Writings
of Gloria Steinem&quot;!  Dan's going to help me out with the equations.<p>
<p>
<b>Ethan:  </b>And Marnie and I are going to start a support group for the
athletically challenged.  I'm really gonna miss you guys.  One thing, though,
I'm starving! I haven't had a bite to eat since I got that hot dog in
Encinaland!<p>
<p>
<b>Dean Montoya</b>: <i>(Enters with oven mitts on both hands, a &quot;Kiss the
Cook&quot; apron, a chef's hat, and a tray full of cookies.)   </i>Did someone say
they're hungry?<p>
<p>
<b>Kathryn</b>: It's James Montoya, the dean of Admissions! And he's got
cookies!<p>
<p>
<b>Dean Montoya</b>: Chocolate chip! <i>(Everyone takes cookies.)</i><p>
<p>
<b>Alex</b>:  Dean Montoya, where have you been? We were afraid the Weenies had
gotten you!<p>
<p>
<b>Dean Montoya</b>: They did! I've been locked up in the kitchen of the
Weeniebago ever since they staged the breakup! But I baked cookies to pass the
time while I planned my escape. They're still hot! <p>
<p>
<i>(As everyone goes for the cookies, Virgil and Alex wind up together
downstage.)</i> <p>
<p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  Uh, Alex, can I talk to you for a second?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex: </b> Sure, what's up?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:</b>  You know, I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometime.  We
could go bowling, or maybe to Hip Hop night at the Coffee House.<i>  </i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b>Alex: </b> Yeah, sure, Virgil.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:  </b><i>(Doesn't seem to hear her.)   </i>Or if that doesn't blow
your skirt up, we could go rollerblading in the steam tunnels, or --<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b>I said &quot;Yes,&quot; Virgil.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:  </b>Or if you can't, that's cool too.  Are you going to Flicks on
Sunday?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b><i>(Screams.)  </i>Virgil, shut up!  What part of &quot;Yes&quot; don't you
understand?<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil:  </b><i>(Lightbulb!)   </i>You mean you don't have a dead boyfriend
who's gonna come back to life? <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:  </b>No, Virgil.  I'm all yours.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil: </b> <i>(He's jumpin' out of his pants.)  </i>YES!  <i>(He plants a
big kiss on her lips.)</i>  I'm so happy, I'm going to <b>sing</b>!<p>
<p>
<i>The finale begins.  People are also on hoppity-hops.  There is dancing and
prancing.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>RE-STANFORDIZE YOURSELF</b><p>
<blockquote>
<b>VIRGIL:  </b>We gotta trample down these stupid walls<br>
	And from our ashes rise<br>
	We gotta get ourselves together, babe<br>
	It's time to Stanfordize.<br>
<p>
<b>ALL:   </b>Reunifacation's the only cure<br>
	For the way our school down-sized.<br>
	We'll hold hands all the way around Campus  Drive<br>
	It's time we Stanfordized.<br>
<p>
<b>BRIDGE:  </b>Techies and Fuzzies will dance cheek to cheek<br>
	While artists and engineers scrump in the quad.<b></b><br>
<b></b><i>  	</i>&quot;Kum ba yah&quot; sing the athletes, the hippies, the Greeks<br>
	In harmonious chorus, like peas in a pod.<br>
<p>
<b>CHORUS:</b>  Those Berkeley bufoons tried to steal Big Game,<br>
	But our  Cardinal spirit was too strong to die.<br>
	We're going to scramble on up to Berkeley, game day,<br>
	And bake some Weenie Pie.<br>
<i></i><p>
<i>A big Mariachi band is playing the whole time and the cast dances a random
number from Ballet Folklorico during this break. Dean Montoya should have a
dance break somewhere in here. Soft shoe? Flamenco? If Montoya can/will sing,
perhaps he can have a verse here.</i><p>

<b>Kathryn:  </b>I'm so hot from all that dancing.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Virgil</b>: <i>(Looking deeply into Alex's eyes.)  </i> I'm feeling pretty
hot, too!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Alex:</b>  And I'm <b>really</b> thirsty!  <p>
<p>
<b>All:</b>  Hey, Kool-Aid!!!<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Kool-Aid: </b> Oh, yeah!<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Crash-a-bamma-boomma-yah.  Kool-Aid man who is actually the drum major
crashes through wall separating fuzzies and techies outside of physics
department. The whole damn band comes in and for one brief moment the entire

<a name="version-info">Version Info</a><p>

This is close to the version which was eventually performed, but many
of the songs evolved slight changes by opening night:

<p>

The verses immediately following the bridge of &quot;Get Sensitive&quot; were cut, up
to Alex's rebuttal.  It was a down-tempo song and got too long.

<p>

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody in Hell&quot; was extended to include the Wayne's
World headbang segment.  (The Wayne's World movie came out that summer.)
I think another verse was added but I can't remember it.

<p>

&quot;The Screaming of the Trees&quot; sounded SO much like a Les Mis song
thanks to Greg Chun's writing (and singing!) that the choreography
ended up being taken directly from the show (that surreal four-step
march) and the last verse was replaced entirely with a brilliant
segue into &quot;One Day More&quot; while a huge red flag was waved by Flag Boy
upstage.

<p>

The song Jerry Day was cut during Tech Week because... well... nobody
ever bothered to write the music, and the words weren't very funny either.
A number of lines from that scene were cut as well.  Basically the show
is over by that point, so the scene was kind of a downer.  And then
there's always the problem that nobody here actually KNOWS anything about
Cal, so you can't make really effective jokes about them!

<p>

Dean Montoya sang the last verse of &quot;Stanfordize Yourself&quot;.
